LLs are covered by a single AI OR single LL is covered by several Ais,Relation of AIs to LLs
"People can skip steps in change management documents and Incident Reports, and the role of a bar raiser to ensure that they weren't skipped or whitewashed or downplayed",Quality of IR documents and AIs
"Interesting to think about LLs (and associated AIs) as an accumulation of wisdom to use the next time something is done (redesign of deployment mechanisms). Maybe the redesign will occur with a number of this having been identified. And maybe having enough of these accumulated will prompt (as well as guide) the next design. Doesn’t sound like the LL/AI dictates, but informs the future design.",AIs can be considered as an accumulation of wisdom
"so there's a little tension here about like what kinds of depth of issues an action item can really reasonably tackle. And there's sort of a desire to keep it like, everything in an action item has to be finished in three months.",Scope of AIs
automated systems actually that tracked whether or not the actions had been completed. Or at least whether or not the actions had been attested to be completed.,What happens over time to AIs
long term preventive actions usually were involved in the creation of a plan. So the outcome was not the thing that was got done. The outcome was we have a plan to do this thing. And then that would usually get stuck into a teams road map. And they would eventually grind away on that.,What happens over time to AIs

So let's get rid of the Oracle database. That took five years.,Long term AIs (five years to complete)
"(interviewer) after you've seen enough of these, you are motivated to get rid of them (interviewee:) yep",Long term AIs (why they have long term ones that require scope)
Building on the multiple incidents contributing to larger initiatives (accumulation concept). Families of LLs/AIs/Root causes lead to motivation and direction for larger projects.,Isolated Learning

we are not that good at knowing in advance how risky a change is going to be,Learning amidst change and uncertainty
you will see incidents that happen because of things we added to the system earlier from previous incidents,Effect of actions over time
"the challenge is that like everything is kind of like a trade off, right? And there's not like a knob that you can turn to improve things, right? It's always like you're always balancing different kinds of things",What is done is always a tradeoff

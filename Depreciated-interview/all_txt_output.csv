In each of the Examples above, each individual entry is a JSON Output of the code + topic + keywords. The Example JSON Output Lists are not a requirement, however I think they will be quite helpful in giving examples of the type of information required.

Also note that ""Topic"" statements should be relevant to the code. For Example 1, both of the entries ""Code"": ""No Flu Experience"" and ""Code"": ""Heavy Colds"" have a ""Topic"": ""Symptoms""

In addition, each entry should contain at least one ""Keyword"", and if there is a relevant pair of keywords, the pair of keywords should be listed. You can have as many keywords as necessary,"

What's interesting is that the first input can be considered an answer and will be coded, however the second input, with no extra text, will be ignored from coding by our system. This is important for our dataset as it is critical to maintain a 50% threshold of answers in order to qualify as a good response for an interview.

Interviewer: Is there anything else that we didn't cover that you would like to add?

Answer: Um, I mean, it's a personal choice. I, er, wasn't, I couldn't get one myself because I, I have an immune system disorder in the past. But um, it's a personal choice, just like getting anything, so no, I never really thought much about it.

Interviewer:  Well, you know, we've gone over the symptoms a lot on this, but if your child does come down with the flu, like in your opinion what would you consider to be the most dangerous symptom that will affect her?
Answer:
Um, I'd probably think that being quite delirious or unconscious would, you know, to the extent that you knew you couldn't keep her awake. Cause I think that would be an indication the fever is quite high. And the body is, its going really deep. And you need to get her to medical help.

## For the code above, how are we going to set up this format of this? If you take a look at the dictionary example on the slides you'll see how in each dictionary entry, there's a key, which is a string, and a value, which is anything. For the above two examples, this is a bit awkward to do as I have three keys, one, in each dictionary entry, that is always the same and the other two keys change according to the value of the interview question. What we're going to do to get around this problem is put the constants into a separate dictionary and then within each dictionary entry, we'll just have two keys"

I think I can get the interviewer's prompts to be consistent, I'm not sure if I will be able to put it in a JSON. Also, we could put this information in a different format but at the very least our team would have to write out the entire conversation including the interviewer's prompt and if they have a response or not. I don't know if we need the interviewer's prompt but I will be sure to tell him and see if he wants to add it to them. Also, we can put a 1-3 word statement about the topic in there.

ts9_0,"Now so we can get started by doing a kind of a consent process. So I'm going to read you a series of statements and I'll just have you Say yes, I agree to them, or no, I don't.","Alright, Okay."
ts9_1,"Alright, so the first statement is I confirm that I have read the information sheet for this study. I've had the opportunity to consider the information asked questions and have had these questions answered satisfactorily.",Yeah I agree
ts9_2,"I understand that my participation is voluntary, and that I am free to withdraw at any time without giving any reason. I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview.",I agree.
ts9_3,I understand the information collected during my interview may be looked at by other researchers from Newcastle University who are working on or assisting with this study. I give permission for these individuals to have access to this information.,I agree
ts9_4,Understand that information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for use in future researcher teaching purposes and that the data will be thoroughly anonymized first,I agree
ts9_5,I understand that the interview will be audio or video recorded according to my preference typed out and all identifying personal details will be removed.,I agree.
ts9_6,"I understand that direct quotations may be taken from what I say and use in research or publications, but I will not be identifiable from these quotations.",I agree.
ts9_7,And I agree to take part in this study.,"Yeah, I agree."
ts9_8,"Excellent. And there's just two last things. So if you'd like to receive a copy of the research findings, I can send those to you after the studies completed and send those to your email address.","Yeah, that's fine. I know my wife is involved as well so she'll probably get a copy as well. So yeah, send them to me anyway."
ts9_9,Excellent. Yep. I can do that. So that'll be in August of this year once the project is completed. And I can also mail you a hard copy of all the study documents if you'd like. Or if you prefer email that's fine too.,Email is fine
ts9_10,"Alright, Excellent. So thank you very much for that. That's all that out of the way. So you have four children. Is that right?","Yeah, I've got four."
ts9_11,"Yeah, and it's two sets of twins it looks like?","Yeah. That's correct, yeah."
ts9_12,"So two of your children or seven and two are four. Is that right, that's right, yeah. So how are they doing with, you know, all of them being at home these days?","They haven't strangled each other yet which I'm considering a plus point. For the most part they're alright because they have siblings to play with and stuff. They kind of, you know, they're not suffering from any kind of loneliness, which I'm thinking some of their are. I think sometimes just want to get away from each other. We've got quite a big garden and a decent sized house so it's going okay."
ts9_13,Yeah with four children I think you would need a decent sized garden. I cant imagine it would work any other way.,No
ts9_14,"Yeah. Um, so can you tell me a little bit about what you know about the flu? when you hear the word flu what kind of things do you think of?","So obviously I think of flu as being the influenza virus. It's basically associated with general things, it's your aches and pains, your nausea, your headaches. It kind of manifests as cold symptoms just on a much worse basis. Quite a high death rate around the world, not so much in the UK, but certainly in less developed parts of the world, in elderly people and people who are more vulnerable to infection from other things anyway. Yeah."
ts9_15,"Yeah, sure. Um, so if one of your children were starting to get the flu. What symptoms would you expect to see in them?","Probably just generally off color, not acting themselves. Maybe a bit grumpy and tired, lethargic and and along with that complaining of aches and pains. And you know, generally not wanting to do anything that they normally want to do."
ts9_16,"Yeah, that's good. Um, so is flu, something you would be worried about your child one of your children became ill with? Or is it something that is more like, well, if they get it you know they get it. Obviously, you don't want it to happen.","Yeah, I put it down as one of these things that if they're going to catch it, they're going to catch it. Theres a certain amount of precaution you can take but you can't just live your life hiding from everything. So if they did show symptoms I wouldn't be worried, unless they got to the point where obviously if it was a hospitalisation then I'd be really worried."
ts9_17,"Yeah, yeah, of course. Um, so can you point to me as far as what you think getting sick with the flu is like for kids. So not necessarily symptoms, but more like is it a serious illness? How long you think they'd be sick for? You know, those kids if things, if you know what I mean.","Yeah, I think that the majority, it wouldn't be that serious.It would be more just a case of maybe a week of recuperation needed. But then obviously if its more, more serious than we could be looking at a good three or four weeks, potentially hospital visits or even hospitalisation full stop. Obviously there are an antiviral meds, but I'm totally unware if they're possible to give to children so I don't know if that would shorten it."
ts9_18,"Yeah, absolutely. So have any of your children ever gotten the flu before? Do you know anyone whose children have gotten the flu?","Uh no, I don't know of anyone’s children. Certainly not any of mine."
ts9_19,"Yeah. Um, so if you want to learn more about a sickness, like the flu, where would you go to get that information as far as like symptoms treatment options, you know, any thing.","Me personally I'd probably go to the NHS website which obviously in the UK is the authority. But then there are others the CDC in America website has details, the WHO has quite a lot of information on there as well just as a general list of what the symptoms around the world are."
ts9_20,Yeah. So you would start with the NHS but then kind of move on to some of those other like health authority kind of websites.,"Yeah, I like to try, rather than just having a single approach to have a more general, sometimes some of the smaller symptoms may not always be listed on one website, they just kind of get buried."
ts9_21,"Yeah. Um, have you ever talked to a medical professional about the flu like maybe your children's, one of your kids' GP or like a health visitor or just any other you know medical professional?","Not about flu specifically in children, but about myself I have, yeah."
ts9_22,"Oh okay, was it because you were ill?","Yeah, yeah, I had the flu."
ts9_23,Ah yeah. So what do you think the benefits are of having your children get the flu vaccine?,"Its risk mitigation in my mind. There is very, very, very little risk in giving them the vaccine. It's well proven well serving vaccince. And rather than them getting ill, and  it might be mild, you know, you never know, it could turn serious. So I'd rather not take the chance and I'll get them the vaccine to stop them from turning, you know, likely to stop them from getting, you know, any sort of potential serious illness."
ts9_24,"Yeah, absolutely. So the, it seems like the main benefit for you. It would just be, you know, that way the kids can't get sick right?","Yeah, yeah, yeah, pretty straightforward."
ts9_25,"Yeah. Um, so, do you think there are downsides of getting the flu vaccine and that can be, when I say downsides here, I don't just mean side effects. I mean, like, uou know,  maybe it's inconvenient, maybe it takes a really long time you know any downsides you can think of at all.","No I don't see any down sides for children in the UK. It's free. It's obviously just the nasal, nasal spray. So there's no inconvenience there. Kids wine afterwards a bit, you know someone’s sticking something up their nose, but aside from that, no there's no, no, no side effects anything I'd worry about or anything like that. So no real downsides"
ts9_26,"Yeah, so pretty, pretty easy. Like you said, pretty straightforward. So if you want to learn more about a vaccine, like whether it is something that would be beneficial for your children, whether it's something that's recommended for them. Where would you go to get that information?","Uh the WHO. Well, I would use google in the UK to find out who was creating the vaccine and then I would go to that website and find out more information on their website."
ts9_27,"Okay, so you'd actually look for the the vaccine manufacturers information about that it?","Yeah, yeah."
ts9_28,"Have you. So have your, your four year old children have they received the flu vaccine this year?","Not in 2020 but they did get it, at the backend of, well it would have been last year now wouldn't it? But it would have been the back end of 2019."
ts9_29,"Yeah, in like the autumn of 2019.",Yeah.
ts9_30,"Yeah. And did you when they got the vaccine. Did you talk to their GP or like any, you know, nurses, about the vaccine at that time, or did you not have any--","I personally was at sea, so it was my wife that took them for it."
ts9_31,"Okay. Well, that makes that easy. Do you remember if there were any concerns about like anything that you needed to talk that she needed to talk to the GP about at the time?","No, there was no concerns. My wife is a PhD. So she does, she's a research scientist. She did a lot of research, previous to any a vaccine that my kids get anyway. And she was more than happy and by that and so am I."
ts9_32,"Yeah. So you were, so it sounds like what you're saying is your wife had done a lot of research and sort of you trusted her research into it and agreed with that conclusions?",Yeah.
ts9_33,"So how important was it to you that your children would be vaccinated for the flu. Is it something that as soon as you, you know, weren't they were eligible, you were making an appointment or was it something that was more like, Well, you know. We'll see.","I'd put it up there as pretty important because obviously nobody wants to see their kids sick with anything. And again, you know, just, by building antibodies throughout childhood it helps them going forward."
ts9_34,"Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Um, so, do you remember, you know, obviously, it was a while ago now and it's a lot, a lot has happened since then but do you remember how you learned that your children were eligible to get the vaccine this past fall? Like, did you get a letter, a text message, phone call?","It was a letter from the NHS. We might have had a text message from the doctor, like our own practice. But those all go to my wife's phone because I'm away a lot of the time so I wouldn't get it."
ts9_35,"Yeah. Um, so once you had gotten that letter. And again, obviously, this was a while ago. But once you've gotten that letter, Do you know how easy the process was getting them vaccinated. Was it just ring up the GP make an appointment. You go in, or was it.","Yeah, it was. I think we just rang up the GP, got an appointment, and brought them in, fortnightly at the most."
ts9_36,"Yeah. Was it so as any part of the process challenging at all, or was it all just very straightforward?",Very straightforward.
ts9_37,"So have your children received any other vaccinations, like the standard childhood vaccinations?",Yeah they've all had their full standard childhood vaccinations up to date.
ts9_38,And can you explain how you decided they should receive those vaccinations? or was there even a decision to be made there at all?,"There was no real decision to be made at all. I've very much in favour of vaccinations and as is my wife. It was just ""that’s what we're going to do."""
ts9_39,"Yeah, absolutely. So it's, again, it seems like from what you said your wife, and you as well, have a lot of faith in sort of science and the medical science rounding vaccines. So you just sort of trust. You know, trust that that science has determined and safe and that's all you need to be convinced. Is that accurate?","Yeah I'd say thats accurate. There is a certain amount of Googling done and looking at the NHS website to learn about the side effects just so that we need to know what to expect off the back of it. Just in case, you know if the kids start having something afterwards, like after the meningitis vaccine we knew what we were looking for. But yeah, I have full faith that these things are safe."
ts9_40,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, so have you personally had the flu vaccine is year?",Yes. Right. Yes I have done.
ts9_41,Yeah. And was that something that was made available through your employer or was that something you sought out independently?,Something I sought out myself.
ts9_42,"Yeah, do you receive the flu vaccine on the NHS or is that something that you had to seek out privately?",Private paid for.
ts9_43,"Yeah, um, that's great. So yeah, just kind of, you know, those last couple questions are just trying to get a sense for sort of how important vaccination is what what sort of priority, you put on it. So that's great. Thank you. Um, so that is actually all my questions we got through them pretty quickly, which it tends to be fairly easy to do when your  answers are relatively straightforward.",Yeah I imagine that speaking to an antivaxer is a lot more difficult.
ts9_44,"Well some people certainly have a lot more to say about it than others, thats for sure. But that, so the kind of the last thing that I like to close on is just. Is there anything else about the flu, or the flu vaccine, or vaccination in general, anything that I didn't ask about that you want to speak to during this interview?","No, no, I'm pretty happy with all of that. As I say, my wife is a research scientist so she tends to tell me what I need to know and anything else I can find out myself."
ts8_0,"Alright, so we can go ahead and get started with a consent sheet. So I'm going to read you a series of statements and I'll just have you answer either yes or no to each of these","Okay,"
ts8_1,"so it does get a little bit repetitive towards the end. But, you know, here we are. All right, so the first one I confirm that I have read the information sheet for this study. I've had the opportunity to consider the information to ask questions and I've had these questions answered satisfactorily.",Yes.
ts8_2,"I understand that my participation is voluntary, and then I am free to withdraw it anytime without giving any reason. I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview.","Yes,"
ts8_3,I understand that information collected during my interview may be looked at by other researchers from Newcastle University who are working on or assisting with the study and give permission for these individuals to have access to this information.,Yes.
ts8_4,I understand that information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for use in future research or teaching purposes that the data will be thoroughly anonymized first.,Yeah.
ts8_5,I understand that the interview will be audio video recorded according to my preference typed out and that all identifying personal details will be removed.,Yeah
ts8_6,"I understand that direct quotations may be taken from what I say and used in research or publications, but that I will not be identifiable from these quotations.",Yes
ts8_7,I agree to take part in this study.,Yes
ts8_8,"Excellent. And then there's just two other things here. If you'd like to receive a copy of the research findings. You can either tell me that. Now, or you can email me after our interview if you'd like to get a summary at the end of the study.",That's great. Yeah.
ts8_9,"Yeah, absolutely. So I can send those to your email address that we corresponded on once I finish my dissertation, so towards the end of August,  you can expect to see that. Yeah, um, and if you'd like to receive a hard copy of the study documents I can mail you those.","No, don't worry. Soft copies of things is fine."
ts8_10,"Um, so that's out of the way we can move on to some of the questions here. So can you tell me a little bit about your child. Like, how old are they? You said he, right?","Yeah, he’s [Child]. He's coming up to two and a half in two weeks. He was born in January 2018. He's obviously currently mainly at home, he's back at nursery two days a week now."
ts8_11,"Yeah. How is he doing at home? or maybe the better question is, how are you doing with having him at home?","Yeah, you know, it took a few weeks to, to shake down into a routine. I've been splitting childcare with my husband, he's also working from home. So it's taken a while to get used to. But we were all fine. And I think the university has been pretty good in terms accomodating."
ts8_12,"Yeah, its nice to hear that.","And then obviously He's back in nursery two days, which he's loving. But coming back very tired. So that's changed the dynamic a bit again. But no, it's been okay."
ts8_13,"Yeah, I'm sure it's nice to have him back at nursery, just so that he can see some other faces and interact with some other people.","Yeah, he loves other children."
ts8_14,"Yeah. Um, so he's your only child. Is that right? yeah.","Yeah, that's right."
ts8_15,"Okay. Um, so, and what's his name again?",[Child].
ts8_16,"[Child], right sorry I know you said that.","Thats okay, don't worry."
ts8_17,So can you tell me a little bit about what you know about the flu? Just sort of your first impressions when you hear the word flu?,"Hmm. Um, I guess. I mean, I've had the flu, maybe twice in my life as a teenager and as a fresher. Both times were horrendous not, not something I would ever wish on anyone and I know that it can be more dangerous that folder people pregnant women, children. I used to get given a flu vaccine when I worked for a private company. They used to pay for staff to have them. And I've always thought that was a really good idea because it's just an unpleasant illness. It's preventable obviously. I guess the vaccine depends on whether they've identified the most virulent strain that year. And there are other strains and things going around. So it's not foolproof. But yeah, just what I know about it is that flu is pretty contagious, pretty unpleasant illness I guess that affects people globally."
ts8_18,"Yeah. Can you tell me what sort of like, if [Child] was coming down with the flu, what symptoms would you expect to see him developing? What things would tip you off that he was coming down with flu?","A high temperature. Obviously he's, if he's quite young child so crying, very sort of flushed... what else would I expect? Maybe, maybe sort of clammy, sweaty, not sleeping, very clingy, off his food. I mean, so many childhood diseases start with those symptoms but those, those are the, what I would expect to see."
ts8_19,"Yeah. Is it something you think, like does it come on really fast, or is it something that is, you know, kind of a slower, like most childhood illnesses like you sort of see it over a few days?","Yeah, I'm not. I hadn't thought about that. I guess I would consider it something that came on over, say, one to two days. I wouldn't think of it as being a really slow burner. I wouldn't think of something appearing overnight.But I might be wrong about that. I think you'd get that sense of them starting to be a bit on well a bit wingey and then get that temperature. Maybe going floppy if it got really bad."
ts8_20,"Sure, yeah. With with children, his age, I think so much of it is about you know, kind of reading what you can see, because of course you know that they cant tell you. You know, I've got a headache. I've got this. I've got that. So it's a lot of it. I think comes down to just what you see happening.","Right, yeah."
ts8_21,"So do you worry about [Child] getting the flu? Is that something you know if you heard, kind of, if you knew that [Child] was going to get the flu. Is that something that worry you, or is it something you know, of course you don't want it to happen. But would it be concerning or something that you wouldn't be too worried about?","You know, I don't spend a lot of time worrying about that kind of thing. Um, I think if it happened, or if we knew that say there'd been flu going round his nursery, or he'd been sort of exposed that we would keep a really close eye on him and, you know, take him to someone as soon as we saw anything coming on, I guess. I guess my knowledge is limited in terms of what can be done for children, once they've got it. I hadn't really, yeah I haven't really thought about that. It's not something that occupies me in terms of, you know, worrying about whether it gets this, that, or the other. I'm not sure there's much that can be done to prevent it unless you really wrap them in in cotton wool and don't take them anywhere. And obviously with coronavirus this has been, it's been a very interesting one because you know, nobody's going anywhere but with children are not that not that at risk.  Whereas in flu I know can be quite dangerous for young children, which is presumably why they offer a vaccine. He didn't get he wasn't eligible for for one this year, which I found frustrating because He was in childcare and, you know, but"
ts8_22,"So this, is his birthday just before, I think it's like late August or something?","Yeah, he turned two in January. So I don't know. He just missed the cutoff."
ts8_23,"Yeah. So can you explain to me what you think, you sort of already did, but can you explain what you think getting sick with the flu is like for kids in terms of, I guess, would you think that the symptoms are any different between adults and children, how long would you expect them to be ill for, you know, that kind of thing?","Yeah, I guess I don't, I guess, I don't know, I guess when I had flu. I was sick for about... It was quicker than a cold, so five days? For five days. I guess with children. I guess it would be quick. I guess it would be sort of two, three days, really. I imagine it would peak quickly. But again, that is complete speculation and having not seen a child with the flu and not actually looked into it as much as I possibly could. You're making me think I need to research this a bit more. You know, and I imagine it would be very confusing for them. And I imagine it would progress quickly in children."
ts8_24,"Yeah, no., don't worry about it. Part of what I'm doing is just trying to learn, you know, kind of, how much parents know about the flu. And if you don't, you know, if you're not confident in what you know that's that's interesting as well. So, you know, no worries about that at all. Okay. Um, so I think you actually just said. So you don't know anyone whose child has gotten sick with the flu. Is that right?","Yeah, no, I don't."
ts8_25,"So if you want to learn more about a sickness, like the flu, you know, anything from symptoms to who is at risk, just kind of anything about the flu, where would you go to get that information?","I generally just go to the Internet and the NHS website. I find really, it's really helpful. It's quite a balanced View. I mean, if I guess if I put something into Google NHS comes up quite high and then people like the Mayo Clinic come up as well. And I always think it's interesting to see a different point of view, from different countries because you get, you know, a slightly different take on it and different um... I think, take that I take into account that the NHS is sometimes very... um, I'm not sure what the word is. Not modest but quite... is very kind of Restrained sometimes in some of its advice. So I find it interesting to kind of get get other advice from, from what I see as reputable sources, but it will be medical websites."
ts8_26,"Yeah. So you said Mayo Clinic. Are there any others that come to mind or is it just sort of, you know, you kind of make a decision as your going?","It's not and sometimes they're sort of, maybe not for the flu, but for other things I've looked at before kind of specialist charities websites, I think, a really useful source of information."
ts8_27,"Yeah, sure. Um, have you ever talked to your child's GP or another medical professional about the flu.",No.
ts8_28,Is that because you haven't had any reason to or you know--,"I've never suspected of them have enough having the flu. It's not something that either my partner or  I've had since having him. And I just know that he was too young to receive the vaccine. I think had we gotten the vaccine and maybe looked into it a bit more Id've discussed it with the GP. But, you know, in general, I know we'll talk about vaccines, I'm sure, but that but that's sort of doesn't concern me, giving him a vaccine. So no, it's not something we've discussed"
ts8_29,"Sure, yeah, so you've sort of led me into my next my next questions here. What do you think the benefits are of having your child get the flu vaccine?","I'd say that in my mind that they are much less likely to get flu is major benefits. And, and also much less likely to spread Flu within the community and it's sort of protective against, you know, for other people in the community as well."
ts8_30,"Yeah. So do you think that, I'm curious about that sort of protective benefit, you know, protecting the community as well as your child. Do you think that's something that you would have thought about before, sort of the coronavirus started going around? Because there's been so much emphasis put on, you know, everybody having an obligation to protect the community. Is that something you had thought about before this or is it something that's come to your attention after the fact?","Yeah, its an interesting question really. I think it would be something I thought about before mainly related to measles outbreaks. I know that there were, there are certain parts of the country where the vaccine uptake is very low, certain parts of the you know, the world where vaccine uptake is is low. And in those places they've had quite big outbreaks of measles and so I guess it would be related to them. Yeah."
ts8_31,"Yeah, that's interesting. So it's it's seeing that vaccinating for measles has an important community protecting effect that has sort of transfered to you feeling that the flu vaccine also has that same effect.","Yeah, I've got no scientific evidence for that, actually, but that's, that's how I feel about vaccines in general, I guess I feel like that's, that's it."
ts8_32,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, so what do you think the downsides are of having your child get the flu vaccine and downsides can be? You know, not just side effects, but you know like inconvenience would be a downside, cost would be a downside. You know, kind of, kind of any any downsides that you can think of.","Um, obviously, the side effects for me would be would be the, the only worry, or the main one. You know, that possibility that they will be unwell for a couple of days or feel under the weather. Theres the possibility I guess that it might not make a difference and they maybe had it unnecessarily. But for me, that's not a downside. I think it's protected. I can't think of any other downside. He's not gonna remember the pain of a needle. If it is a needle. I assume it's a needle, but it might be one of those sugar cube ones. I don't know. Yeah, no, I can't think of any downsides."
ts8_33,"Sure. No, that's, that's fine. So if you want to learn more about a vaccination. Is that something you know, it could be anything from, like, who is it recommended for, does he need it, what are the benefits, what are the downsides. Where do you go to do that kind of learning? Is that also something you do on the internet or is it something you're more likely to talk to a medical professional about?","So, certainly when he was he was little and he had vaccines I, because it was a schedule of vaccines and you'd be going in for one and then you'd be talking about when the next set were I would talk with the nurse, probably, who was giving them. Occasionally the GP about the next set and what those were about and and you know what they covered and sort of benefits or not of those. Now that he's away from that regular schedule I don't feel I really had an opportunity to talk to a medical professional about those. I guess I will get a letter or whatever from the surgery when it's time for him to have his three and a half year vaccines and which will sort of coincide with this flu season as well. I guess it will be must be October or something. And I don't feel, I mean, I could. I feel like I could ring the doctors. I don't have any concerns. If I did, I would just go to the NHS website and I would just solely probably use a British, the British NHS website for for that research."
ts8_34,"For learning about vaccines. Yeah. Um, is there a reason that you would have a more narrow focus to just resources from the NHS for learning about vaccines or is that, you know? Can you kind of explain that a little to me?","Well, I guess I don't know what the policy is in the US. I don't know how it differs. I don't know. Or, you know, Australia, or whatever. I don't know whether the drug used is the same, I don't know whether they even vaccination. It's the same types of flu, whether any of that. So I just feel like it's a more specific solution in the, you know, I feel like flu is a general illnesses, the same all over the world, different strains, obviously. Um, but the vaccine is you know something specifically the NHS is paid for and will be distributing and therefore it's always you know them I would go to for that."
ts8_35,"Yeah, so it's, it sounds like what you're saying is it's less about a fear of inaccurate information and more just, you don't, it's not relevant. Information coming out of other countries just aren't relevant to you.","Yeah, yeah."
ts8_36,"Okay. So have you ever talked to your GP, or like any medical professional, maybe it's GP or a nurse or anybody about the flu vaccine in particular?","No. I've had the flu vaccine several times and never queried it. It's just been like, well, this is a vaccine, I'll have it. I don't personally, I've never had an any, but I've had friends who've had negative side effects and reactions against vaccines. I've been very fortunate I haven't had any to anything I've taken or anything I've had vaccine wise, no. So no, I haven't had any conversations with them there."
ts8_37,"Yeah, sure. Um, so you mentioned that [Child] was not able to have the flu vaccine this year, right?",That's right.
ts8_38,Yeah. So how did you find out that he was not eligible. Did you try to get the vaccine. Can you speak to that a little?,"Yeah, so I looked up. I remember thinking, ""Oh, is that I think that children have? I need to look that up."" I'm thinking he looks like he's in the ineligible bit and I have a support group of NCT. Do you know about the NCT, Natural Childbirth Trust?"
ts8_39,"I'm not familiar, no.","So they're are national charity and they run antenatal classes for parents to be all over the country. They're a charity, you pay for the course and it's extremely popular course preparing you for childbirth, but generally you're sort of buying friends and a support network for when you have the baby. I have a close group of those friends, of six of us on on WhatsApp. So I guess I go to my peers. I remember there was a discussion on there about the flu vaccine because somebody was considering going to private for the flu vaccine. And I think that's what prompted me as well to look it up and just see whether I, you know, thought we needed to go down that route or it would just leave it."
ts8_40,"Yeah. Was that someone, can you remember, is that someone whose child was below the eligibility age?","Yeah, they're all the same age. They're all born around January 2018."
ts8_41,"So is that something that you considered going with a private option for? Or was it when you saw that it wasn't recommended by the NHS that you just thought, ""No, I'm not gonna bother with that""?","That's basically, I think I vaguely entertained the idea and then thought they would, if it was really dangerous for his age group. If I thought he was at really a mortal danger risk than I would expect the NHS to have that covered off, and they dont. I didn't, so I guess I trust it, them, and I did look into it and decided it wasn't, it wasn't worth it."
ts8_42,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, but you had said earlier on that you did want [Child] to have it and that you were, were frustrated by that. So would you say it was really important to you that he would have it this year, or was it something that you know, like. Can you speak to a little bit? Was it something you were upset about when you learned that he wasn't eligible or was it something that was more just like ""oh okay if that's what they said.""","I was a bit frustrated as it was a bit frustrating. Mainly because I think, I think, I assume that what the NHS were doing by cutting off younger children was assuming that all those younger children are at home with their parents and the reason for giving them, you know, I think the reason given given for giving it them after three or two and a half, whatever it is age cutoff is because they're more likely to be in a child care setting. Whereas you know, quite a lot of children these days are in a childcare setting from sort of 10 months. So I found that a bit frustrating, but again, in that sort of trust sense, I thought all this is, this is the way it is. And this year, yeah, if he's entitled to it and they feel like his age group should have it, I will definitely make sure he has it."
ts8_43,He could be exposed to flu like is it something you think you worried about more when he is in nursery or is it something you worry about the same as before?,"Oh definitely, yeah. I definitely worry more in general for all sort of those infectious diseases. You know, he picks up cold really easily like any kid of his age and whenever he gets a cold, he gets a secondary ear infection. So for me, it's sort of unpleasant long process, getting an infection out of him. And so yeah I really, I'd really, that's been one of the upsides of having him at home, he's had no ear infections at all from between February and now. So certainly something I definitely, I don't worry about it, but I'm much more aware of the fact that he's much more likely to get poorly."
ts8_44,"So it sounds like that's would be another sort of benefit of vaccination is that, you know, of course, the primary interest is that he's healthy and he's safe but the sort of secondary benefit is as a parent, you don't have to kind of deal with having a sick child in the house for weeks at a time.","Oh yeah. And you don't him to be, you know he doesn't understand. It's awful for them when they're sick and its awful for the parents. Nobody gets any sleep and it's really worrying. So anything you can do to avoid that kind of pain. It's yeah, I think it's a benefit."
ts8_45,"Absolutely. Makes sense to me. Um, so I do have just a couple other questions, sort of about vaccine in general and sort of your thoughts around that. So has [Child] had the other sort of routine childhood vaccinations?","Yeah, yeah he's had all of those."
ts8_46,"Yeah, and was that something. Can you tell me a little bit about how you decided he should be vaccinated for those or do you feel like it was a decision at all? You know, can you speak to that?","Not a decision. I mean, for us it was just absolute he's having vaccinations. It was never, it was never a conversation. It was never a yes or no, it was just this is his vaccination schedule. My husband's not medically trained, but he's a medicinal chemistry. I'm not a scientist but you know I was vaccinated as a child.I think its one of the great, you know, wonders of the modern world. It would be stupid to turn it down."
ts8_47,"Yeah sure, I can completely understand that. So it was, I just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly, it was just because, you know, they're available you trust the science and kind of the medical institutions.","Yeah, and I don't see the downside. So even if something is less effective than maybe it's advertised to be, or should be, or if something. I don't know, if the evidence, if it's seen as an unnecessary actually if you look into it and you realize that young children aren't at that much risk from certain diseases and it's sort of an  enormous and unnecessary injection that's for other people to decide for me. There's no downside of having it. So that's, yeah. I guess that's how I feel."
ts8_48,"Yeah. And you mentioned earlier to that your thinking was, like, even if it's an unnecessary injection. It's such a quick, you know, thing, and he's not going to remember it anyway.","Exactly, yeah."
ts8_49,Have you personally had the flu vaccine this year.,No.
ts8_50,"Is that, do you think that's just because it wasn't available or was that a decision kind of that you made.","I wasn't on the list for this winter so it wasn't, it wasn't a consideration. I don't consider myself to be in a high risk group."
ts8_51,"Sure. Yeah, absolutely.",I had it when I was pregnant with him.
ts8_52,"Okay, so, yeah. So when you were pregnant with them and you were part of a high risk group. Was that something you got through the GP?","Through the GP yeah. Because it was available. I wouldn't pay. As I said, I used to take advantage of it when my private employer paid for it. But it's not something I would pay for for myself."
ts8_53,"Yeah, you just don't see sort of the the sort of the cost in that situation--","You know I don't even know how much it would cost. Its a funny one because you think well I cared enough to give it a bit done when the nurse came round but it was because it was just there and available and didn't require any administration, didn't require any money. And but then it's, then that thinking about as a next step, I don't consider it a high risk enough illness me at this stage of life that I would, I would feel like I needed to pay for it."
ts8_54,"Yeah, well, there's an I think there's a lot of other costs there to, you know, maybe not monetary costs, but you have to take the time out of your day to figure out where to go. You have to actually go there, you need to kind of go through the whole process and pay the money. So I think it makes sense that if you're not worried about having flu yourself that the costs of that, you know, kind of all the costs would outweigh the benefit that you would get from the vaccine.",Yeah absolutely..
ts8_55,"Yeah, that makes sense to me. So that is sort of the last of my questions. So what I just like to kind of close on. Is there anything else that you'd like to say about the flu or the flu vaccine or vaccination in general, anything that I didn't ask about that you'd like to speak to?","And no I don't, I don't think so. I think you've made me think I might look at my look it up in a bit more detail. You know, and just and just educate myself a bit more about kind of risk factors for young children. Not only up having the vaccine. Actually, but more about having the flu, because you know that's not something I've necessarily looked into that much. And no, I think that's it. Thank you."
ts8_56,"Yeah, absolutely. The NHS website has some really great resources for parents when I started my dissertation, that's where I did my first research. I went to the NHS website and did some reading all about flu and you know how it affects children and everything. So if you are interested thats definitely the place to start, would be with the NHS website.","Yeah, great."
ts6_0,"I understand that my participation is voluntary, and that I am free to withdraw anytime without giving any reason. I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview.",Yes.
ts6_1,"I understand the information collected during my interview, maybe like that by other researchers from Newcastle University who are working on or assisting with the study I give permission for these individuals to have access to this information.",Yes.
ts6_2,I understand that information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for use in future research for teaching purposes that the data will be thoroughly anonymized first.,Yes
ts6_3,I understand that the interview will be audio video recorded typed out and then my identifying personal details will be removed.,Yes.
ts6_4,"I understand the direct quotations may be taken from what I say and used in research or publications, but I will not be identifiable from these quotations.",Yes
ts6_5,"Right, and I agree to take part in this study,",yes.
ts6_6,"Excellent. So there are two other things here. If you would like to receive a copy of the research findings. Upon completion of the study, you can tell me or email me after the study is finished.","Yeah, I'd like to have a copy. That's okay."
ts6_7,"Yeah, absolutely. So I will finish my study by the end of August, so I'll send you the the findings probably towards the end of August. Thank you. Yeah. And would you like to receive a hard copy of the study documents I would mail those to you.","Ah, whatever is easier.It doesn't have to be a hard copy. If you just email thats fine."
ts6_8,"Yeah, so I can, I can send you an email.","Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. Yeah"
ts6_9,"Absolutely. All right, so that's that out of the way. So we can kind of dive into some of my questions here. So my first couple questions are just get to know kind of your children a little bit better get a sense for what you know about the flu. So you have two children. Right?","Yes, yeah."
ts6_10,How old are they?,"Ah my little girls two, she's gonna turn three next month, and my little boys five."
ts6_11,Very nice. So the five year old has started school?,"That's right, yeah. So it would have been, would be in, he's in reception. Yeah."
ts6_12,"Yeah, would be in reception, should be in reception, is in reception, its all kind of a gray area at this point.",Yeah.
ts6_13,"That's great. So  what kind of things today like to do, how are they doing at home?","Well, they like to squabble a lot. Yeah, they are very imaginative, the two of them and they're like to come up with all sorts of like different role play type games that they create their own universe and run around and play in that, So, yeah, they're quite high energy, quite active like to be doing lots of things usually to get me to do a lot of those things."
ts6_14,"Sure, yeah, that's a lot. Sounds nice and you are certainly not the first person I've talked to that has said that their kids like to squabble during lockdown. Seems to be a favorite of all the children. So can you tell me a little bit about what you know about the flu? Just sort of your first impressions like symptoms. Is it serious? is it a problem for children or a problem for adults? you know, anything you can kind of tell me about it.","Yeah, and I'm not very scientifically minded at all and but I know that the flu is a virus and that its seasonal. And that it has different symptoms and affects different people in different ways. I feel like is it something that can be quite serious for some people. And in like in my household definitely my son's got he's suffered from viral wheez. So he's been hospitalized a few times as a result of that. So we take quite seriously. Also, my husband and I both had an asthma. And so it's something where I've had the flu. A few times and I've been very unwell with it. And so yeah, we've got all these other people in the family who suffer from respiratory problems and and my mother in law's had the flu and it's developed into pneumonia for her as well. I think she's been quite ill with it. So yeah, it's something that can be quite bad."
ts6_15,"Yeah, yeah. So do you worry about your children getting the flu or is it something you think mostly like older people kind of worru about?","Ya know I, I do get concerned about my kids getting the flu and particularly if my daughter got it cause I know all her, she's not got a great immune system. And so, and I've, because I've had the flu myself a few times and I've been really unwell with it. Kind of aches, pains, and like all sorts of horrible, horrible symptoms, I really wouldn't want them to have it. And also, like being a parent, looking after an ill child is just no fun at all. So, yeah, so the reasons but I mean I know if they did get it, it's not, it's something that you know it's unlikely to actually kill them or anything like that. But it is something that could make quite unwell for that time. So, yeah."
ts6_16,"Yeah. So what do you think like if you were watching, you know, you're kind of keeping an eye on your children. You see them starting to get ill. And you think that they're getting the flu. What symptoms would you expect to see that would kind of tip you off to the fact that they're getting flu.","I think I would probably see a big drop in energy levels from them. So I think that would probably be the first thing I don't know what the equivalent word is like but we, I would say that they look a bit 'felt'. That's the word that would tend to use to describe them so they just kind of Not quite themselves. They're not, sort of, I mean, they might have cold symptoms, but I don't think that would be what would make me think it was flu because they always get colds, like all the time. But it would be more the kind of a drop in energy level, complaining about aches and pains, and probably they're getting kind of, you know, temperature with that and but even if they were having things like, like, like a bad tummy or something like that. I might wonder, and whether it could be the flu."
ts6_17,"Yeah, no, that's great. Um, so you mentioned that you have had the flu, a few times in the past. Um, do you know anyone have your children or do you know anyone whose children have had the flu?","No, actually. No, I don't. Now that you've said that I don't know of any kids that have actually had the flu."
ts6_18,"Sure, absolutely. Um, so when you want to learn about a sickness, like the flu, even if it's just you know, like you want to learn symptoms or you want to learn, you know, what you can do to to help them get better when they have it. Where do you go to get that kind of information?",Ah the NHS website.
ts6_19,"Yeah. Are there any others, or is it just there?","NHS website is probably the first one I would go to you because I think it's probably more likely the reliable than anything else on the internet and but I've looked at this Web MD and that one comes up all the time and that one seems quite good. That's probably where I'd go. If it was something, if I didn't think it was something like a flu and something that I wasn't sure of what it was and I thought that my kid was really unwell I'd phone 111. I've phoned them before and told them the symptoms over the phone before. That's when they seemed quite unwell with something."
ts6_20,"Yeah, so if it was like, just general knowledge, you'd probably go online and if it was something more immediately concerning you would be inclined to 111. Is that kind of?",Yeah
ts6_21,"Have you ever talked to your child's GP about the flu, or to like any medical professional?","I have done because, um but not specifically about the flu. I've spoken to them about the flu vaccination before and because my son has severe food allergies. He's allergic to egg and he's allergic to milk and I'd heard that you couldn't have the flu vaccination, if you've got an egg allergy. So I've spoken to, and he's got an allergy specialist team. So I've spoken to them quite extensively about it in the fall."
ts6_22,Yeah. And how did that conversation go? Can you tell me a little more about that? Did seem to be knowledgeable about the subject it. Was it helpful to you or no?,"Yeah, and [Son]'s allergy  team at hospital are just like incredible people. And they know so much and I  have 100% confidence in what they were telling me. So they said that the information that we'd received to say that there was a, you know, that he couldn't have it because he couldn't have the vaccination because he has an egg allergy was wrong. So that's completely out of date and that the actual way that the flu vaccinations cultivated wouldn't actually, I think it's the way that it's extracted or something like I'm sorry I'm not very scientific minded. The actual protein that would cause an allergic reaction, there wouldn't be even any trace of it at all um, in the flu vaccination. So it was perfectly safe for him to have it from the allergy teams point of view. And that was really good, but it's almost, kind of every time a consent form or something like that comes around. It almost makes it like challenging for us toTo fill that in, we have to put kind of extra explanation. ""Yes he does have an egg allergy. But yes, it is safe for him to use it. And this information is out of date. And you need to contact his allergy team about it and here's the number"""
ts6_23,"So it sounds like, um when there is a kind of discrepancy in information that you would tend to go with the allergy team because is it. Can you tell me why that is exactly what sort of makes us kind of take their advice more seriously?","Oh this loads of reasons why. And so, from personal experience, my son, and was diagnosed with it allergy when he was six months old, and it was because I'd fed him some porridge. It was the first thing he'd ever eaten, and it had milk powder in it and he had an anaphylactic reaction and he nearly died. And it was, it was horrific, traumatic. It was very intense and at the time I didn't really know what was happening and it took him to the GP and everything. He called immediately in emergency response team and you gave him oxygen and kind of gave him adrenaline and kind of brought him back round to consciousness, but he was completely floppy. He was completely unconscious. It was horrific and but at that time. But at the time there was so many factors around it. So prior to him having that allergic reaction I had spoken to you at least one GP and to health visitors about what I thought was my son's severe eczema and they said it wasn't eczema. ""It's just dry skin"". And for me, you kind of basically stop worrying about it. Stop fussing about it. And I thought, ""Well, I'm a new mother, and I've got no idea what I'm doing here. So I'll take their advice and I'll just put these creams on."" That made it worse and all sorts of things. After, immediately after [Son] had his anaphalactic shock, the allergy specialist who I'm referring to, after the pediatric doctors had kind of got him safe and stable. He came to visit us and explain what was going on and gave us. Sorry, I'm getting upset about it was such a hard experience."
ts6_24,"No, no, I, I appreciate you telling me about it. If you know, if you decide that you don't want to talk about this anymore. Please feel free to tell me to move on and we will move on.","Thank you, no, just bear with me from getting a bit, but it was emotional. And so the allergy specialist came in and we talked about it. And he said, I mean, I hadn't said anything about his eczema or anything like that. And he said, ""Well, one of the first signs that it was likely that your son was going to have a, you know, potential food allergy or was at risk for having a food allergy is eczema."" But at that up until that point, all of the health specialists that I'd spoken to had told me ""it's not eczema, it's just dry skin"". So I felt at that time horrific because I thought ""I knew that he had a problem and I knew he had eczema"" and if somebody told me. ""Oh, Your son's got eczema, you know, be careful when introducing foods that are common allergens"" that I might have avoided such a traumatic experience for all of us, because he could have died at that point, if I hadn't got the medical attention straightaway. So it's something that's quite simple. You know, going to see a GP health visitor about eczema, but then lead into something like this and being told straightaway. ""Well, this is the first sign that you know it could have ended up like this."" So, so he does definitely you know and the team, they know so much about it. But it didn't kind of stop there because At the time, the pediatric doctor and the allergy specialist said, ""Look, it's we don't know what it is right now without doing further tests definitively. But we can say, we're fairly confident this is a milk allergy and it's been triggered as a result of the milk powder that was in the porridge, because that's the main allergen that was in there."" So I thought, ""Okay, I've got no idea how process that"" but I phoned the GP. I think the next day just to kind of I think was just because I needed a syringe to administer the medication, they hadn't given me one. So I phoned them to ask about that. And they said, ""oh, did they know what's causing it?"" and said, all ""they think it's a milk allergy"" and the GP I spoke to said, ""well, it's not a milk allergy and milk allergy wouldn't have that reaction. It's, that's not what it is."" And so I just felt really upset again because I was on the phone saying, ""Look, I'm not saying that it's a milk allergy, the pediatric doctors told me that that's what it is."" But they were immediately kind of cutting it there. She just immediately cut it down said ""no you don't know what you're talking about. Basically, it's not a milk allergy that's incredibly rare that wouldn't have happened that wouldn't have had that reaction"". And then, lo and behold, he had his allergy tests and it was a milk allergy and he had a very severe reaction, even though it's rare. It did happen. I'm not saying it was their fault. You know, it's, it is rare, and you know that might be the general advice that they give to people, but my confidence in what, in the health visitors and the GP have about very specialist things like that was quite severely undermined, at that point. But the allergy team have so specialized in it and they know so much about it, and have personal experience in it. I absolutely trust, kind of, everything that they tell me and I follow all of their advice. Sorry, about that! It was a horrible experience."
ts6_25,So what do you think the benefits are of having your children get the flu vaccine or are there any benefits to it?,"So I think it's probably two main benefits. One is that it will protect them from having the flu, which they'll become unwell with and and yeah, I don't really want to see them, you know, in a position where they're very unwell. But the other thing as well as I think it's important for them to get it and not spread it to, you know, the people who are more susceptible or who can't have a vaccine or who, even if they do have a vaccine, the vaccines potentially less effective in them. You know, they like to spend a lot of time with grandparents who might have the flu vaccine, but it might not be as effective in them because the older. Also there's a little boy and my son's class and he had leukemia, who has leukemia. Well, he's recovering from leukemia, but you know, you're very, very, very aware that there are some children out there who just can't. Who can't have it and, you know, they can't come across things like this. SO like I said they're  the two main reasons."
ts6_26,"Yeah, so that's interesting. So it's sort of like there's two, if I'm understanding correctly, like the there's two benefits. There's, you know, your child won't get sick, but also like a collective benefit almost responsibility to have them vaccinated to protect other people.",Yeah
ts6_27,"Yeah. Do you think, I'm curious and this is, you know, maybe there's nothing to this, but I wonder, do you think that that sort of collective benefit of protecting other people is something that you thought about before the coronavirus started going around?, You know because there's been so much emphasis on ""stay home save lives"". Do you think that that is something you valued beforehand or is that something that you're realizing is valuable now?",It's something that came beforehand. I probably hadn't thought about it as much until he started school and does the little boy in his class with leukemia.
ts6_28,"Mm hmm. So that sort of that interaction, knowing that there is someone who needed that protection, is sort of what made you start to value it?","Yeah, I mean, I would have always, I would have always given them vaccinations anyway. And just generally to kind of protect them from it and like, why would you not? Sorry, I just don't understand why you would ever not. but I hadn't thought, particularly if the benefit, for, in terms of him, potentially spreading it, I probably hadn't really thought about that as much until there was a little boy who's really unwell. You know, his mother was always sending us kind of messages to, like, ""please let us know if your child's coming down with any of these infectious diseases, or viruses or whatever, because you know it's going to put him in hospital for a long time."" So, yeah."
ts6_29,"Yeah, that, that sounds like a very powerful motivator. Um, do you think there are downsides to having your child get the flu vaccine or not?","So, the actual vaccine itself. I don't think there's any particular downsides. I've never, when they've had it, I've never noticed them be unwwell, or anything like that as a result. It's mildly inconvenient and sometimes they don't want to have it. But other than that, the actual vaccine itself. I don't see any downside."
ts6_30,"Yeah, but like so. So when you say mildly inconvenient. You mean like just getting just getting in, organizing it, arranging it?",Yeah.
ts6_31,"So when you talked to. You said you talked to the allergy specialist about the flu vaccine, what prompted you to start thinking about the vaccine? You mentioned a letter. It was that something that came from your GP or what, what, can you tell me a little more about that?","Yes, so we were invited in for the first time that we, I think, I cant remember but we got an invitation, invitation for my son to have the flu vaccine. And I think part of, I don't know if there's a medical form or something that you had to fill in and it mentioned about egg allergy. So that just I think that's what kind of led me to it. But I'm fairly confident our invitation for um, to get the vaccine came from the GP."
ts6_32,"Yeah. Um, so, has your daughter been vaccinated as well, or just your son?","So if we're talking just about if we're talking about this season. So las, just maybe before Christmas time. My son was vaccinated in school as part of their school program that they run. And the letter that was referring to the just now, this time, was a form that we have fill in for the school. But my daughter was invited for a flu vaccine, but we haven't had her vaccinated."
ts6_33,"Yeah. Um, so can you explain so you got that invitation to vaccinate can you. Was it a decision not to vaccinate or is it just sort of something that happened?","Yeah, so when I talked about the mild inconvenience. That's where this comes in because the GP had, they'd organized and it was quite short window of clinics that they had available and they only were available at certain times on Friday. Now I work part time but Friday's one of the days that I'm in work. And also my daughter's in playgroup that day. So I think Id got a text message actually from them to say, and if your child's age two they can come along to get this, you can sign in with one of these clinics. So what happened was, I think when I got the message. I thought, ""Oh no, I'm going to have to organize time off. And then I'm going to have to organize being able to pick my kid up"" and like all this kind of stuff. So I just didn't get round to it straightaway because I thought, ""I've got to do these things"". And then when I did and I phoned them up and they said ""It's all booked up and we're not, we don't have any more clinics and available."" I think that was only, it was a quite a short time frame. I can't remember exactly what it was. And then they said, ""well get back in touch with us about making another appointment and we'll let you know if his clinics available"" but I thought, ""well, how will I, how do I know when the next available window is?"" And then I never heard back from them. So it was, so it's more a logistic problem that we couldn't get there because it was on a day that work."
ts6_34,"Yeah, no. That makes sense. Um, so it wasn't it sounding like it wasn't important to you that she not receive the vaccine. It was just sort of the inconvenience. It just didn't kind of end up happening is that correct, or am I sort of misunderstanding?","That's right. I actually did wanted to have the vaccine. I just didn't have the, I just, I wasn't able to arrange it and then when I did phone up to arrange it. It was no longer available."
ts6_35,"Yeah. And do you happen to know like what time of year it was, you know, can you guess it the month at all or no?",I think it might have been umm....
ts6_36,"Yeah, it was a long time ago.","I know. I think it was around November. It was definitely and it wasn't October, I think it was, I think it was slipping around November time. We have like so many different things going on at that time as well because it's kind of between October and December when both of the children just start school at the same time there's like a million different things to do. I think was November."
ts6_37,"Yeah okay yeah that's that's great to know. Thank you. So we are coming up on the end here, my last few questions are just kind of general and they helped me learn on your thoughts about vaccination as a whole. So have your children received any other vaccinations, like the routine childhood vaccinations.","Yeah, they both received all of their routine and childhood vaccinations."
ts6_38,"Um, can you explain how you decided that they will receive those vaccinations? Like, was it something you researched, something you talk to your GP about, or was it something that you just said you know, you didn't really feel like you needed to learn about you just decided to kind of do it, you know, can you speak to that a little?","Yeah, I think it was. There was never any question. There was never any doubt that we would get them vaccinated. So I didn't do any research. I don't know if, when it, when I was little. When I was a little girl. I remember like when I was a child at school, I remember some, I remember people coming down with things like meningitis and like the other, with these other onditions that they're able to get vaccinated against and being severely ill and all. There's no way I'm having my kids suffer from any of these conditions, if I can avoid it. So they're definitely getting vaccinated."
ts6_39,Yeah. Yes. Have you have you personally had the flu vaccine this year?,"Ah, yes."
ts6_40,And how did that work out? like how did you get that vaccine was it something that was offered through work or something you went to a pharmacy for?,"So it was something that was offered through work. So Newcastle University had signed up to some sort of partnership with boots chemist and and they were offering free vaccinations. So yeah, went in and got that."
ts6_41,"Yeah, that certainly makes that easy. So that was my, my last question, but the thing I kind of like to close on is just, is there anything about the flu, or flu vaccine, or vaccination in general, just anything that I didn't ask about that you were hoping we could talk about before we kind of close things off there.","Ah no problem. Probably one of the things I mentioned just about the whole allergy side of things, like, I don't know if this impact on the research that you're doing it all, but just that and things like that get kind of updated in the kind of the advice from the allergy side of things is updated, but the advice that we are given as parents isn't right and I think it would put probably, you know, if I hadn't had such a good relationship with the allergy team, it would quite easily put you off to say, ""well, no, I'm not going to get them vaccinated because it says here that causes a problem."" So I think that kind of and I guess one side being updated and the other side not being updated as a bit of a problem. That's a bit of a problem."
ts12_0,And the first thing we'll do is I have a consent sheet here that will go through and I'll just ask say yes or no to each of these statements.,Okay.
ts12_1,"The other thing I just like to tell everyone in the beginning I know with kids in the house that can be kind of hard, things happen. So if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know. We can take a break and if something comes up and you need to stop the interview completley, thats fine too.","That's fine, no problem."
ts12_2,"Alright, so with the consent sheet. The first statement is I confirm that I have read information sheet for this study. I've had the opportunity to consider this information, ask questions have had these questions answered satisfactorily.",That's all fine. Yeah.
ts12_3,"Excellent. I understand that my participation is voluntary, and that I am free to withdraw it anytime without giving any reason. I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview.",That's fine.
ts12_4,I understand that information collected during my interview may be looked at by other researchers from Newcastle University who are working on or assisting with the study I give permission for these individuals to have access this information.,"Yeah, that's fine."
ts12_5,"Yeah, I understand the information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for use in future research or teaching purposes and that the data will be thoroughly anonymized first","Yeah, that's fine."
ts12_6,I understand that the interview will be audio or video recorded according to my preference types out and that all identifying personal details will be or,"Yep, that's fine."
ts12_7,"I understand the direct quotations may be taken from what I say and used in research publications, but I will not be identifiable from these","Yeah, that's all fine."
ts12_8,and the last one is I agree to take part in this study.,"Yep, yep, that's fine."
ts12_9,Excellent. And would you like to receive a copy of the research findings on the study is complete?,"Yeah, that would be useful actually in my, in my role. We've got other members of the team that are involved in terms of screening as well. So I think it'll be interesting to see the findings, definitely."
ts12_10,"Yeah, absolutely. So the study is scheduled to end at the end of August. So that's when I would have some findings to share. So I would send those to the email that we corresponded on.","Brilliant, that'll be great."
ts12_11,Yeah. And would you like to receive a hard copy of study documents I would mail those two,And no electronic will be fine. Yeah.
ts12_12,"Alright, so that's the consent sheet out of the way. So we can go ahead and dive in here. So can you tell me just a little bit about yourself. You know anything, anything really what you do for work kind of where you're from, anything?","So, yeah, yeah. So I am, I live in South Shields. I work in public health. So I've got an interest in kind of all things to do with kind of health and well being in any way. I work for [Employer]. So I found out about the study through them. Well, it's actually through [Person] because I've studied under [Person] before doing some MsC modules and things like that as bit CPD. So I think [Person] had been promoting this study, and it was something that I thought I can contribute and help out with. So that's kind of the, the key thing for me but, but yeah, I work in [Employer and employer location] on kind of tobacco and alcohol mainly, but also sport. A lot of work around or healthy aging as well. So not so much the young people but the more, more older people. But as I mentioned in the in the email, I've got two young children one's four and one's 2. So a daughter who's four and a son who's two. So yeah that's, that's kind of another reason for, for wanting to contribute to the study really."
ts12_13,"Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Um, so, you tell me a little bit about your children. How are they doing with the everything?","Yeah, it's been an interesting time. They've been pretty good, to be fair. Obviously they haven't been at nursery at this time. So my eldest would be in preschool nursery, but obviously since the lockdown, since the pandemic, that's been closed and they haven't actually reopened yet so she's literally been off, off, off nursery school for the whole time. She's due to go back in September, when she would start and reception. So all being well she'll be going back mid September. So, you know, we hope that the school have everything in place by then and it will be safe to do that. And my youngest is two kids three in November and he's, he goes to a private nursery. But again, we haven't sent them back there just yet. So he's been off a few months as well. But the be managing pretty well, they've been getting sent, certainly [Daughter] my eldest, has been getting sent information, a little bit of work from the nursery. And so we've been trying to do that, I think, when we can between work. But me and my wife both work pretty much full time, so it has been difficult kind of looking after them and also working at the same time, but hopefully things are going to improve now with the lockdown being relaxed. Hopefully grandparents, being able to have them for a little bit of time now moving forward. So that should make it a little bit easier now, give them a bit more interesting things to do outside of being with us all the time because. Obviously they haven't really been able to see them, just from the end of the drive or on video calls and things like that. So, you know, that's getting a bit better now. I know that being able to see them over the weekend and things like that will be nice. But yeah, they seemed to be doing pretty well."
ts12_14,"Yeah, it's a little bit hard to know, sometimes, who has a harder time with lockdown the children or their parents.","Yeah, definitely. Yeah, it's been a bit of a juggling act, I think, keeping them entertained and also doing my day job. but yeah yeah we've managed okay."
ts12_15,"Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm glad to hear that. So can you tell me a kind of your first impressions, your first thoughts around flu? That can be anything from, like, is it a serious illness, what kind of symptoms do you expect to see, kind of anything first thoughts around flu.","Yeah, so I know a little bit from my yeah, kind of studies and from work, etc. I think it is quite a serious issue. I think, you know, moving forward as well with the latest pandemic. It could be worse, given the strains on the healthcare system and things like that.But yeah, I think I'm certainly aware of the the seriousness of it for certain at risk groups in particular. So anyone who's already vulnerable or has a long term condition and who are elderly, orvery young, obviously are at higher risk and yeah, you know, the whole aim of the kind of screening program has been to protect those at risk groups up, you know, first and foremost. Also in terms of developmening, herd immunity across the whole community as well. So I've always been for the campaign obviously I understand the evidence base behind it and I always had a flu jab myself. You know, we get provided with that as healthcare workers and as public health workers through our employer. But equally, I think, you know, we see the benefits to, to our children as well in terms of protecting them. But also protecting all the vulnerable people that they come in contact with as well, obviously, when they're at school, when they see elderly grandparents and things like that as well. So, um, as far as signs and symptoms. I think I possibly only had flu once in my life and it may have just been a really bad bug. But I was literally bed bound for it when I was at university for a few, good few days. And so it may have been may have been flu. I think from a symptoms point of view it was just the usual kind of fever, nausea, muscle aches, just high temperature and things like that, really, yeah. Yeah, so they were probably my, my kind of bad symptoms, I would say."
ts12_16,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, so is is flu, something that, you know, obviously you don't want your children to get sick. But if you you know where to find out that one of your children was going to get the flu, would that be something that you would be worried about, or is it something you would be more, you know, kind of feeling like it's not such a big deal. Can you give me a sense for that?","I think I'd be slightly worried. I think that the latest pandemics probably made people even more concerned around kind of respiratory disease and issues and bugs and things like that. So yeah, I think I probably be slightly concerned although thankfully, touch wood, my children are fit and healthy. But, you know, you still dont want them to go through something like that. And obviously you hear it, you know, you do hear of kind of outbreaks and a lot of kind of deaths and morbidity as a result of it um, throughout a number of different places. We've had some some bad outbreaks in the past in, in the kind of North East region and you read about it from elsewhere as well. So, you know, I think you'd always have those those concerns. But equally, I think, you know, I wouldn't be hugely worried. I think I probably be more concerned about the impact of people who could potentially then be infected by by other people who are obviously more vulnerable, people kind of, with COPD and or other long term conditions or who might be me immunosuppressed. I think it'd be probably more concerned about the wider family, I suppose, then, then my kids themselves. But, but yeah you would naturally have some, some worries and concerns I think, think if we knew that they were going to be infected by it and there was a big outbreak, definitely."
ts12_17,"Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting. So you're kind of, one of your concerns, in that is not just for your children's health, but also for kind of the health of the family like the wider group.","Yeah, yeah, given how infecctive it can be. I think, yeah, you know, you'd be probably equally concerned about the knock on effect that it could have on other people as well as young people themselves. I think generally young people have a fairly mild, but not always. And again, you know, same as COVID-19  and other respiratory viral infections, I think you know, anyone can can get it and certain people can always be quite badly affected by as well. So yeah, there'd definitely be concerns."
ts12_18,"Yeah, I'm see you started to talk about this a little bit. But I'm curious, just to hear kind of any other thoughts you have. Do you think there are, there is a difference like a significant difference between how children and get sick with the flu and how adults get sick? Whether that's like symptoms severity anything or do you think it's pretty much the same, whether you're an adult or a child. It just depends, kind of on your health beforehand.","Yeah, I mean, I think I would probably say, although I don't know how how clear the evidence base is around it. But I'd probably say that young people will be slightly more able to defend against it, then others would be. So I think, you know, that might be kind of them speculating slightly, but that I'd probably assume that young people probably don't have it as bad and impact and as severe symptoms as adults would. I'm not 100% about that, to be honest. I think it probably does vary and I think people could still get a particularly serious bout of it. And, and, again, I think it probably does come down to underlying factors and other conditions, long term conditions. So the medications or conditions that they might suffer from. Here with my children being healthy and not having any underlying conditions. I'd be quite confident that they would, they would get through it and you know it would be fairly mild. But as I say, you know, that's not always going to be the case, you know, that could be a particularly harmful strain and obviously we have had a number of different strains over the last few years and, you know, some of them more infectious or more deadly than others. I guess so, yeah. I'd say that would be my perception of it."
ts12_19,"Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Um, so you mentioned that you had had the flu. When you were in university. Do you know anyone who's had, you know, if their children have ever had the flu you can you think of anyone?","Yeah, I think I'd probably know if they had something as serious as that. And yeah, you know, if they were really really ran down with it, unless it was a very, very mild case of it. But, you know, again, thankfully, the haven't had any any serious kind of colds or illnesses before. So I would expect it probably haven't had it. I couldn't be 100% confident about it and I can't even be 100% confident that I had it. It felt like it was bad but it could have just been a another type of virus, but yeah, yeah."
ts12_20,"Yeah, absolutely. So do you know anyone like maybe your children's friends or, you know, Friends of yours that have children. Do you know anyone who has a child who's had flu or not really?","Not personally, I think I'm just aware of that there has been outbreaks in the past. So we have had cases locally, where there's been outbreaks in schools, and schools have either closed or have certainly had to isolate certian children or certain classes to protect any further outbreaks. So I'm aware of that from a public health perspective. I don't think off the top my head I know any personal friends children have had flu, actually, or that they were 100% positive that it was. So as I say, just, just what I've heard, or what I'm aware of, some kind of local intelligence in terms of outbreaks in schools and things like that, I think, yeah."
ts12_21,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, so have you ever talked to your child's GP or another medical professional about the flu or have you not felt like you needed to? You know, obviously, with your background, you might be a little more sort of health literate then then many people are. Have you ever felt the need to talk to a medical professional about the flu?","Probably not, to be honest. No, we haven't really had to take them to those sorts of settings all that frequently other than when they were very young in the might have had a high temperature, I think. I probably never felt the need to specifically raise that issue in isolation. I think the only time it's ever really cropped up is when they've actually been for their vaccination and obviously we had a conversation with the health professional about it then. And obviously the highlight is kind of why it's important. And kind of what to look out for in terms of any side effects and things like that. So I've spoken about flu in general as part of that, I would say. Yeah, but not routinely as part of any other appointment or anything like that."
ts12_22,"Yeah, that makes sense. Um, so if you want to learn what it's like--",Sorry about that
ts12_23,"That's okay. Um, so if you want to learn more about a sickness, like the flu, whether that's like symptoms or, you know, kind of home treatments things to watch out for. Where do you go to get that kind of information?","Um probably NHS 111 or NHS dot UK [Meaning NHS.uk] I think most of the information, if I just want some basic details about a particular condition or any sort of illness really, I think my first port of call would probably be online. I would always use, you know, you're around, you kind of, more, more, kind of evidence based websites and things lik that. I wouldn't just Google it and click on a random website. I think I would always start at the NHS. So yeah, NHS dot UK or NHS 111 and then basically go from there for any further information. But yeah, yeah I think I would always start there definitely."
ts12_24,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, so sort of shifting focus a little bit to think about the flu vaccine specifically. Um, yeah, I was just looking over the, the expression of interest survey. So did both of your children have the flu vaccine this year?","And my So my eldest did, had it, had it kind of at the start of the last season and will be eligible and again this year, my youngest hasn't had it yet because he hasn't been eligible. He's just missed coming into the age range this year because he turns three in November. I think he just missed out last year, but he'll be eligible this year. So, yeah. He'll have an appoitnment."
ts12_25,"Yeah, absolutely. So what do you the benefits of having your child get the flu vaccine are? You know, any sort of any benefits or positives that come to mind.","So yeah, I think. I think, obviously, first and foremost, it's protecting against those most common strains. I'm aware that it won't always give someone total immunity because they could well be other strains and other viruses that they can still pick up I suppose. Every year the vaccine kind of changes slightly and will protect them against those more common strains. I think that's how I understand it. So in terms of the benefits, obviously it's going to protect them against those most common strains and then naturally it would then, I guess, thinking about like herd immunity, would prevent them passing, passing that on to others as well. If you get enough enough children vaccinated, of the population vaccinated. I'm probably a little bit less clued up on whether it can also give them a little bit more protection against other colds and viruses and things like that. I think there's a bit of a kind of urban myth, around, around that. That potentially the vaccine might protect you against other colds and kind of sniffles and things like that. I've certainly heard people say that anecdotally in the past. I don't know how true it is to be honest. I know that, certainly when I've had it in the past, I've gone through, you know, the kind of winter season and not really had any major coughs or sniffles or anything like that. I don't know whether that was solely down having the flu vaccine or whether I just been lucky, to be honest. So I don't know how much extra benefit my children would get from a kind of broader protection, cold and sniffles point of view, or whether it's really just those common strains of flu that they're protected against. But, but yeah I think that's the main benefit for them really is hopefully being protected against those more common strains."
ts12_26,"Yeah. So it sounds like from what you said. It sounds like there's two levels of benefit. There's the main benefit, which is that it's protecting your children's health but also a little more broadly, you know you brought up again the protective benefit for the community.","Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I think that wider benefit then too, to the kind of surrounding family and,you know, other people they might come in contact with as well in terms of not being able to then carry it in infect other people as well. Yeah, yeah."
ts12_27,"So what do you think the downsides are of having your child get the flu vaccine? and downsides doesn't specifically need to be adverse reactions. You know, it can include that. But it could be anything, you know about the process that is not, you know, not positive.","Yeah, and I don't think there's many downsides to be honest. I'm, I'm all for things and screening, to be honest. But I suppose the only, the only downside really is there are probably the the acute issues around, the unpleasentness of it, if it's a jab, then obviously you know that's not pleasant for them. And I know my eldest had the nasal spray, can't remember when it was no actually, it must be getting on from... Yeah, must have been like last October, I think, probably around that sort of time September, October. And that's seemed a lot better. It wasn't too intrusive, she was absolutely fine with it. A lot better than you know the jabs and things like that. So there wasn't any downsides, from my point of view in terms of its administration, it was absolutely fine. The only other downside. I guess it's just a little bit of the inconvenience of having to make the appointment to physically go to the to the doctors and the GP. You know, to make time to be able to go and do it. You know, but I'm quite lucky that I work quite flexibly and you know either me or my or my wife can can usually make the time to take her along. There's usually not too many issues with that really so they're the only only downsides I can see really."
ts12_28,"Yeah. Um, so you mentioned that when you took your daughter to get the vaccine this year that you had a little bit of a conversation with the GP about the vaccine or with me, you know, whoever was administering the vaccine. Can you tell me a little bit more about that conversation? Was that just, did you have any questions that you asked at that time, or was it just quite general?","Just quite general, to be honest. It was just a routine kind of a bit of an explanation about the jab and the fact that it's not a live, not live virus? I forget how it works exactly now. But there's a bit of an explanation about the type of vaccine it was and that it wouldn't give anyone the flu and that there might be a little bit of a side effect in terms of a sniffily nose, maybe a slight, slight temperature. And she just went through, you know, some of the possible symptoms and side effects. Basically, and not to be concerned about that. Just a bit of an explanation about the process, about how the the nasal spray works. And then it was just putting my daughter at ease really. Just, just getting her comfortably and just get ready to, to inhale it really. Um, but other than that, I don't think there was a particularly lengthy conversation from what I remember. I didn't really have any major questions or concerns that I needed to have clarified. You know a little bit about it and how it worked and and how it was administered so. I didn't feel the need to ask any further questions. So it was quite a brief conversation, we just go through the process and then and then have it, the nasal spray, delivered."
ts12_29,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, so. Can you walk me through the process you went through to get the vaccine, to get your daughter vaccinated this year? So, you know, things like how did you know that she needed to be vaccinated, once you found out that she was eligible for the vaccine, how did you go about getting an appointment kind of anything, anything you can tell me about the process of actually getting it?","Well, from what I remember, I think it was just a letter from the GP to indicate that it was due. Amd we just basically need to to to make an appointment. So literally, letter, landed on the doorstep, made a note of it, rung the GP, made the appointment and I think we got we got in pretty quickly. And so it was just a case of just of actually making arrangements to actually work around the appointments, because it was an early morning appointment which suited me quite well. I work in the in the town anyway, so it was relatively easy. It just meant that I could go into work a little later. I think if I remember rightly, it was on a day where my mom would normally babysit so she'd actually followed us to the appointment and then then she took my daughter home afterwards, which meant that I could go straight to work. So there's a little bit of kind of logistics required to when to make the appointment and then to make arrangements for childcare and things like that, then get to work. If I remember rightly my mum was watching her that day, that meant I could basically take her to the appointment, go in with her. That was a dead quick and straightforward process sit in the waiting room and then going along and and having the appointment and then she just jumped back in with my mum, they took them home and I went to work. So that was the process. Basically, it was quite straightforward. It just needed a bit of arrangement in terms of child care really."
ts12_30,"Yeah, that does sound like it was quite straightforward. So before you got that letter, were you aware that she was eligible to be vaccinated or was it because you received this latter that you realized that there was something you could do?","I think the letter served as a bit of a reminder, and I may have forgotten or not got round to it as quickly if I didn't get the letter as a reminder. I may have forgotten. Yeah, we're we're aware that she was eligible for it, and that it would be due at some point. She had it in the previous year. So I think from that perspective, we knew it was coming round, kind of seen it done it before. The year before she had the nasal spray as well. But I can't remember exactly what year that came in and where the change from a jab to the to the nasal spray was. But, um, but, yeah, we were aware that it was kind of comming round. And again, we'll know this kind of in September as well. So we'll be prepared for that. But I think the letter is helpful. It just serves as a bit of a reminder and a bit of, a bit of motivation to make sure we get our boot in basically."
ts12_31,"Yeah, that makes sense. Um so got that letter and you read it and it said, you know, she's due for a flu vaccine. Was that something you were like, yes, she is definitely going to have this vaccine. You know, will call the GP. Now, or is it something you're more like well you know it's we'll see if we got around to it. Essentially, how much of a priority was it for you when you got a letter?","Yeah, it was, it was probably a bit in the in between those two parameters, really. I think, I don't think it was a case of um ""I'll ring in immediately and book it in right this second."" I think we did probably, it was probably just other stuff going on. So probably didn't get round to it straight away. It might have been a few days or a week or so. I think the intention was always that we would get her booked in for it, but there wasn't a massive sense of urgency for it. I don't think, because it was probably quite early in the in the season as well. I think the letters probably came around in about September and obviously you don't often see a big spike until kind of October, November time. So I think I was aware that, you know, it's best to get it sooner rather than later. Obviously, the sooner you get it, the better. But I don't think I was kind of rushing to get it done immediately that I think that was quite happy to sit on it for a week or so."
ts12_32,"Yeah, but it was something like that you knew you wanted to do it wasn't something you wanted to think over?","Yeah, I'd say so. Its something we see as important and still something I would like to do. That probably comes down to my role as well. You know, I think, from a public health perspective, we always advocate for these sorts of things. So I like to try and you know lead by example as well. I feel a bit of a hypocrite. If I didn't so, yeah. So, I suppose from that perspective I felt like, yeah, it's important. I'll get definitely get around to it at some point there was never a question of, kind of, not to get into it."
ts12_33,"Yeah. Um, so that sort of leads me and kind of the last thing I wanted to talk about, which is just to get an idea for your thinking around kind of vaccination as a whole. So have your children received like the standard routine childhood vaccinations?","They have, yes."
ts12_34,"And can you explain a little bit to me about how you decided that they would receive those vaccinations. Was it something you know did you feel like there was even a decision to be made there at all, or was it something that you just sort of always wanted to do?","Um, yeah, I mean, again, I suppose. In a similar vein. I would always see it is important. I understand the evidence base and the importance of it.  I get frustrated and annoyed by some of the theories and conspiracies, you'll read online about vaccines and some other bizzare kind of theories and issues behind some of that. That can be frustrating sometimes, from a public health perspective, that a lot of the fake news and things like that that circulate, so it was never really a decision. I think it was always just something that we would always just get done cause we understand the, kind of, the reasons and the rationale and the safety and the benefits of it. At the end of the day, you know, if you look back at kind of other infectious diseases, in the past like smallpox and polio and things like that and how vaccination has obviously had a huge impact and made a massive difference on them, effectively eradicated those sorts of illnesses. I think you know it's, it's common sense that you should do that with other issues and diseases as well. So, yeah. Yeah, I don't think there's ever a decision that we wouldn't get a door, and I think we would always kind of support routine screening definitely"
ts12_35,"Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Um, so that's actually that was kind of my last questions.Thing that I just like to sort of close on is just a general, is there anything that you want to say about the flu, or the flu vaccine, vaccination in general, just anything that I didn't ask about that you were hoping to get the chance to speak to?","And I don't think so, to be honest. I mean, I think it's important that kind of primary care and the GPS, pharmacies, etc. get behind it and make sure that the do prompt people. Because I think I do worry that sometimes people aren't particularly motivated or they've got other issues going on that they will just think it's not a priority. So I think we probably do need to do more. And this is kind of a public health issue as well, around how we promote and encourage people to come forward and get the various vaccines, you know, for, for any sorts of issues really but, but flu included. I think people probably don't see flu as big of a priority as some of the other childhood vaccinations, simply because they might think that the kids are less at risk or, you know, less likely to have a have a kind of serious issue as the result of flu, whereas all elder elderly people might be more vulnerable. So I definitely think there's some issues around that and it'd be interesting to see the findings of your, your study really understand some of the kind of parental perceptions around all of that. What are the kinds of reasons and barriers and challenges and issues for not for not getting it? And whether you know things like incentives and things like that could work, perhaps as well for more socio-economic issues and deprived areas and things like that, you know, where we know that the takeup isn't as good as good or as high. So yeah, I'm interested in all of that in terms of the kind of the breakdown of that of takeup or and things like that. I don't specifically lead on vaccines and screening within the team, but other members do when, you know, they kind of get all the data and all the figures and things as well. Obviously we promote it heavily within the workplace is kind of how we support our older employees and other businesses that offer it as well and encourage people to get it work if it's more convenient for them as well."
ts12_36,"Ya know, that is, it is really interesting stuff. An interesting you said thing you said was about coronavirus and how everybody is taking respiratory illness, a little more seriously. Now I, you know, I hope that that can be a lesson that comes out all this, but a part of me worries that it might actually have the opposite effect because people may be looking at the coronavirus and saying, ""well, you know, at least it's not, you know, at least flu, isn't that"" you know?","Sure. Yeah, no, that's a bit of a concern, isn't it really as to kind of which way it might go and whether it makes people more concerned about flu this year, thinking, ""oh, well, you know, is another equally dangerous and and harmful virus. I'll definitely get my immunization this year And likewise, I'll get the kids vaccinated as well to give us the best possible outcomes"" If you know, coronavirus may be coming back or whatever it may be, not wanting to have a kind of double headed outbreak of current affairs and flu at the same time, and the impact that will have on the health services, there could be some of that going on. But as you say it could go either way and make it will think, ""oh, well actually clue is not really that bad anymore. I just need to focus on coronavirus I won't bother."" So that'll be really interesting, actually this year and think about how, what the what the immunization rates look like early on and whether we need to do a bit more. The push to really raise its profile again, in light of in the wake of coronavirus. Yeah, yeah, we'll have to think about that for a public health point of view as well."
ts12_37,"Although hopefully everybody is washing their hands, much more than they were before.","Right, yeah."
ts7_0,I understand the information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for use and future research or teaching purposes and that the data will be thoroughly anonymize first,Yeah.
ts7_1,"Yes. Excellent. There are just two other things here. If you would like to receive a copy of the research findings. Upon completion of this study, you can tell me that. Now, or you can email me. You know what I'm",Interested
ts7_2,"And if you'd like to receive a hard copy of the study documents by mail. I'm happy to send those to you, but I would need your mailing address for that.","Now, that's fine enough. Great. Okay."
ts7_3,"All right, so that's that way. So we can go ahead and get started here. So you have one child. Is that right or one child in the age group?","That’s right, one child."
ts7_4,"Can you tell me a little bit about them. What's their name? How old are they? All that, all that good stuff.","He's a little boy called [Child], he is four and a bit now, due to start school in September. He was very premature and so that's something that we take into account when we're thinking about things like his health, but he hasn’t got any lasting effects from that."
ts7_5,"Okay, yeah. And how's he doing, he hasn't he hadn't started reception yet, right? So he's been home through all this?","Yeah, thats right."
ts7_6,"Uh huh. Oh, nice. Yeah. How has he been enjoying having everyone at home most of the time now?","It's been interesting. He's coped quite well with it to be, to be fair. But he was able to go back to his nursery three weeks ago and he's absolutely loving being amongst some of his peers. With him being an only child. It's a bit boring for him to be home with us all the time."
ts7_7,"Yeah, that social interaction with kids his age, I'm sure that's that's very important. I think a lot of the time for for young children, it's almost harder for the parents to adapt to the change than it is for the children.",Mhm
ts7_8,"So can you tell me a little bit about what you know about the flu? Sort of your first impressions when you hear the word flu, any symptoms, kind of, what do you think of when you hear the word flu?","And well I think flu is quite a, quite severe illness really. And I believe I've only had proper flu once. I think the word flu gets bandied around quite light heartedly sometimes when to me, proper flu is it, is a is, an illness that brings coughing, trouble breathing, kind of cold symptoms, but my experience of it was basically a week of being really, really ill. So like I say that was only once in my life. It's, it's, it's something serious and it obviously can have potential complications like pneumonia. So it's not something that I would take lightly. personally"
ts7_9,"Yeah. So do you worry about [Child] getting the flu or is it something that you think is mostly a concern for adults, or can you give me a sense for that?","Um, I don't know whether I i would say I worry about him getting it. And I think it's probably unlikely that he's gonna get it. It is a is a seasonal thing every year, isn't it. So there is always the potential."
ts7_10,"Yeah, sure. So it sounds like what you're saying is, like, it's not something you are actively worrying about but its not something that, you know, you would ever want him to have.","Mhm, yeah."
ts7_11,"So can you explain to me what do you think getting sick with the flu is like specifically for children like what, what would you expect to see if your son was getting the flu?","I'm not, I'm not really sure whether I have an expectation of that. I assume he would present with usual cough or cold kind of symptoms, but be very ill with that for a.. Well not very ill, but more than a normal cold if that makes any sense. I don't particularly know anything really about how flu would affect a child versus how it would affect an adult. But again, like I said with with him being very premature, he was born at 29 weeks gestation, and he had chronic lung disease due to ventilation and and obviously lung immaturity. And so anything like that, although we don't believe he has any lasting complications from that, there is that little bit of that at the back of me mind going ""Well, I wouldn't really want him to get something that's going to be heavy on the chest"". [Inaudible]... even if [Inaudible]... speak well...[Inaudible]."
ts7_12,"Yeah that makes sense why, you know, even if there's no lasting effects I can see why you wouldn't you know you wouldn't be wanting to take any chances with it.","Yeah, I think it's just something that kind of in the back of my mind really"
ts7_13,"Yeah. So do you know anyone whose child has gotten sick with the flu, maybe like any of his friends or, you know, people that you know with children who might be around his age?","No, I don't think I do, to be honest."
ts7_14,"Yeah. So when you want to learn about a sickness, like the flu, where would you go to get that information",The NHS website.
ts7_15,"The NHS website. Are there any others that you use, or is it just straight to the NHS?","Just straight to the NHS. Its just, I'm fully confident in the information that will be on there and that things will be accurate. I mean, you can you can troll around the internet and find all sorts of stuff. You know, if I'm, if I'm looking for something like that. I've got to go to something that I'm sure is a trusted source."
ts7_16,Yeah sure that that makes sense to me. Have you ever talked to [Child]'s GP about the flu or any like medical professional at all?,"No, I don't think I have. No."
ts7_17,Okay. So my next few questions are to help me learn my your thoughts around the flu vaccine and kind of whether or not it's something that would be beneficial for your child. So what do you think the benefits of the flu vaccine are?,"Ah well, it, it just, it just removes some of the risk of him getting ill. I mean, obviously I am aware that that strains of flu are many and varied and that they change every year and that the flu vaccine is only going to be efffective against a percentage of those. It, it just removes some of the risk of him getting really quite ill. Bit of a no brainer for me."
ts7_18,"Yeah, absolutely. No, that does sound like a benefit. So I guess when you think about the benefits you thinking, mostly about the benefit to his health. Like, do you see any sort of other benefits or is it just straightforward. You know, he's not going to get sick, so he's going to be healthier.","Ah, I've probably never particularly thought much beyond that, really. I mean, that is that is my number one concern. I have, I don't really have an understanding of how things like herd immunity and reducing spread in the community can be beneficial and not beneficial to those who cant have it. Obviously I understand that thats significant with things like measles. So I assume there to be some kind of element of that with with the flu vaccine as well. But, to be perfectly honest, if you hadn't asked me the question I probably wouldn't look at it ;ole that."
ts7_19,"Yeah, no, that's, that's great to know, you know, it's, I'm just trying to figure out sort of what the, what the most important parts are so it's good to know that. You know, it makes sense to me, you think flu is serious, get the vaccine, like you said, it's kind of a no brainer.",Yeah.
ts7_20,"So if you want to learn about a vaccine, like whether it, you know, whether it would be beneficial for your child, whether it's something he needs, something he doesn't need, where would you go to get that information?","Um, I probably have an inherent trust of vaccinations and if, if the health community are advising me to have a vaccination for my child, then it's it's not it's not really something I'd look a great deal further into, I don't think. Um, if the GP, If the NHS are telling me that this is a vaccine that they advise my child to have, then I'm pretty much okay with that."
ts7_21,Yeah.,"I don't think I've ever actively gone and looked at any more detail beyond that, to be honest."
ts7_22,"Sure. So it sounds like what you're saying is it's just, you know, if a GP recommends it to you or if some other medical professional recommends it to you, that's kind of all the all the extra information you need to be worth it.","Yeah. For something to be on a on a childhood vaccination schedule, then that's gone through all kinds of levels of consideration and whether thats medical, whether thats ethical. All of those kinds of decisions, I think probably have been made by people with much more of an understanding of everything that I do. I'm lay when it comes to medicine. So I'm pretty happy to take their word for it, if that make sense."
ts7_23,"Yeah no absolutely it just sort of trust. You know, trust the medical experts, essentially, is what it sounds like you're saying.",yeah.
ts7_24,So sort of related to that. Do you think there are any downsides of having your child get the flu vaccine?,"No. No it's, it's a quick and painless thing then its over in a second. I wouldn't have expected him to have any after effects because of it and that’s whats happened, that’s whats bourne out. So no downside to it."
ts7_25,"Sure. Um, so have you ever talked to a medical professional about the flu vaccine. Specifically, kind of, how did you... I guess what I'm trying to learn here is like how did you know that [Child] could get the flu vaccine? Was that a conversation you had with someone? did you, you know, get a letter? Did you find out online?","It, we, I think, yeah, we had, we had a letter inviting him. Actually, this, this has made me think a bit more now because I did look into whether he could have it at a younger age. Um, sort of like the one to two year range. Yeah, kind of that range because of, because of the circumstances of birth and that was something that I did look into. So I did get in touch with his GP and asked whether that was possible. I think, I think it's only kind of children with with specific conditions and stuff like that that are eligible for that. And it turned out that he wasn't. So that that was a conversation that I had with... That would have been the GP, yeah. But as far as and when he was eligible and and I got the letter off that it was available for him. Then I didn't have any any conversation with anyone about that."
ts7_26,"Yeah. So, once you decided to have him vaccinated for the flu this year. Can you walk me through the process of what it was like. You know, to get the vaccination. Was it very simple, you just phone the GP, you had an appointment, you brought him in? Or was it, you know, a little more complicated than that?","No, it was, it was, it was absolutely straightforward. Got the notification through the post and gave them a call, booked an appointment, went in and then showed up for it. The nurse was, the nurse out our practice is lovely and and it was just a very quick and simple, couple of drops up the nose and he was done, got to the end of it and everything was hunky dory."
ts7_27,"Yeah, that sounds about as easy as it can get. So how important was it to you, you know, when you got that letter that said he can get this vaccine. How important was it to that he get it? Was it something that you were like picking up the phone, I'm going to ring them right now and get this appointment? Or was it something you were more like well you know if the opportunity arises will do it?",Ah I think I probably arranged the appointment that day.
ts7_28,Yeah?,"Yeah, more or less straight away. Yeah."
ts7_29,"Yeah. So it sounds like I'm just sort of based on everything that you said, I'm just trying to make sure I'm understanding you correctly, it sounds like you know you have faith in vaccination and in medical professionals. So you're, that faith kind of motivates you to seek out that protection, whenever possible, is that, does that sound accurate to you?","Yeah, yeah."
ts7_30,"So I do have a few other questions that you've sort of already spoken to, you've been pretty clear, but we'll just kind of go through them in case you have anything to add about them. So has has [Child] received any other vaccinations, like the childhood ones?","Yeah, yeah he's fully up to date with all of that."
ts7_31,Yeah. And how did you decide for that he would have those vaccinations? Or do you feel like it even was a decision?,"Uhm I, for me it wasn't really a decision I needed to make. It was, it was a foregone conclusion. And for me, and I did check in with what his dad thought, what is that thought at the time, and he was on the same page, so that was, was just not, not yet, not, not really a decision."
ts7_32,"Yeah, just, you know, it's recommended. It's the thing kind of that you're supposed to do. So you just sort of do it.",Yeah. Yeah.
ts7_33,Have you personally had the flu vaccine this year?,"Yes, I have. I've paid for the vaccine for quite a few years now, and my other half gets it free, because of his previous medical history. So it's something that that we've kind of done and I kind of shoehorn him to get on with it, get cracking. It, actually me, me getting the vaccine this year was more upseting for [Child] than him getting his own"
ts7_34,Oh yeah? In what way was that?,"Well, yeah, we were, we were sitting there in, I think I got it done at the local Tesco. I was sitting there and he was, he was on my knee and he saw the needle coming towards my arm, and it really, really scared him. Like ""wow! Dont worry, they're sticking it in me not you!"""
ts7_35,"Well, it's nice that he was, he was looking out for you didn't, didn't want anybody getting any injections that day. So he when he was vaccinated, he had the nasal spray, Is that right?",Yeah
ts7_36,"So do you think that him having a nasal spray. Like, do you think it would have been kind of a more difficult experience for you and for him if he had needed to get an injection or do you think, you know, what do you think had the setting been a little different?","Ah I think, I think he would still get freaked out, a bit freaked out more than he did with the nasal spray but that would have been very quickly. And again, that wouldn't stop me, yeah."
ts7_37,"Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, so I can imagine that as a parent, when your child needs an injection. You know you it's unpleasant for them, of course, but you sort of know that now in 20 minutes. They're going to be fine. They will have forgotten about this whole situation.","Right, right. Yeah."
ts7_38,"Yeah, but that's nice that you had the nasal spray so that you could sort of avoid that whole, that whole episode. So that's all the questions that I have. So kind of what I like to close with is just asking, is there anything else. That you'd like to say about the flu or the flu vaccine or vaccination in general just anything that I didn't ask that you were hoping you could speak to","And I don't think so. I mean, the possibly, the only other relevant bit of information really is that my mum's a nurse. So I've grown up around hospitals and around, you know, that. And so I think that is quite a big part in my thinking about how much trust in, in the institutions and that's the only other thing, right."
ts7_39,"Yeah, no, that's interesting. So you think just because you've been, you know, sort of, since since you were young exposed to kind of people who people who had faith in medicine, you know, as a nurse, of course. She of course has faith in medicine.",Yeah.
ts7_40,So you think that it was sort of something that it was the environment you grew up in that sort of instilled those values and you?,"Yeah, yeah, that's how it said i think that's that's probably the reason that it. It wasn't even a decision to make is that that's, that's what I know. That's what I brought up with that and I've never had any reason, despite being through some interesting medical situations. I've never had any reason to lose that bit of faith."
ts5_0,"So we'll start with the consent process here. So what I'll do is I'll read you a series of statements and if you could just say, Yes, I agree. Or no, I don't agree to each one. So I confirm that I have read the information sheet for this study. I have had the opportunity to consider the information asked questions and have had these questions answered satisfactorily.",I agree.
ts5_1,I understand that my participation is voluntary and that I can withdraw at any time without giving any reason. I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview.,I agree.
ts5_2,I understand the information collected during my interview may be looked at by other researchers from Newcastle University who are working on or assisting with the study I give permission for these individuals to have access to this information.,I agree.
ts5_3,I understand that information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for us in future research or teaching purposes and that the data will be thoroughly and anonamyised first,I agree
ts5_4,"I understand the direct quotation may be taken from what I say and used in research or publication, but that I will not be identifiable from these quotations.","Yes, I agree."
ts5_5,I agree to take part in this study.,I agree.
ts5_6,"Excellent. And then there's two things here. If you like to receive a copy of the research findings. Once the study is completed. You can either let me know now or at any point by email, you know, after the interviews completed.","I think it will be quite interesting, actually. So, yes. Yeah. Yes."
ts5_7,"Yes, so I will send you those once the studies finished, which will be by the end of August. I'll send them to your email address.","Okay, thank you."
ts5_8,"And if you would like to receive a hard copy of this documents you can let me know now or after the study, but I will need your mailing address so that I can send you all those",That's fine email. Email would be fine.
ts5_9,"Alright, so that's out of the way so we can go ahead and sort of dive in here. So in your expression of interest survey. You said you had two children. Is that right, and what are their names?",[Older Child] and [Younger Child]
ts5_10,"[Older Child] and [Younger Child] and one of them is three years old, and the other is four Is that right?","That's right, yes."
ts5_11,So has the four year old started school yet or no?,"Yes, her birthday falls just on the last day of the cutoff. So she started school in September, reception."
ts5_12,"Yeah, how is she liking it so far?","She was loving it. I think she gets tired and you know that i think they all do, just, you know, on a five day week, gets tired. Then by the end of term she is just shuttered. and we've done homeschooling since 23rd of March, and I think she started enjoying that, I think. She only went back to school yesterday. I think it was time to go back to school and I think she was sick of us. Sick of us, sick of her sister. I think we've worked hard than the school, to be honest. Yeah, but you know, that's that's par for the course. And so, yeah, she loves school and [Younger Child] goes to the nursery at the school so they're in the same place normally."
ts5_13,"Oh, that's nice. Yeah, I think for kids their age, so much of it is like the social aspect is, you know, being around other kids and other adults, you know, their teachers and stuff. Things that normally they dont have contact with and homeschooling is hard on everyone, I think. Yeah.","Yeah, I would agree with that."
ts5_14,"You suddenly become a teacher and they suddenly lose all those, you know, all those experiences that they like.","And they don't respect you as a teacher, either. So getting them to do what you want them to do is actually a lot harder. They challenge you more than they would a teacher in a school, they challenge you. You just have "" I dont want to do that. I want to play. I want to do this"" so its been fun."
ts5_15,"Have they gone back now, or?","No only, only [Older Child] has gone back and she's only back Thursday, Friday. This week, Monday, Tuesday next week and then for the last two weeks of term she's in her for half days. [Younger Child] doesn't, they wouldn't hold nursery because there weren't enough children, which I get. Which is fine. When they're on their own, they're fine."
ts5_16,"Yeah, I grew up, when I grew up, my mum had three boys. We were all close in age and she has been saying throughout this whole process that she's just so incredibly grateful that lockdown happened once we were adults because had she been having the three of us stuck at home for a couple months she would have gone crazy. So you know, I, I appreciate the fact that this has been, you know, quite a, quite a month. A couple months.","Yes, but it's, you know, up to us. I say all that, but it's been very rewarding because we because we both work work full time. And the amount of time we actually get to spend with them through the week is very limited. You know, you get that half hour, 45 minutes in the morning. And then you get an hour, maybe when they come in from school that they were home from work. So the time we get together as a family is quite limited. Normally, so this has actually been very, very good experience so a point of note. The one side has been very challenging, but on the other, just been very rewarding as well."
ts5_17,"Well that's nice that. Yeah, that's a nice kind of silver lining to it.",yeah yeah
ts5_18,"Yeah, so could you tell me a little bit about what you know about the flu? like when you think of flu what as far as symptoms. Is it serious thing that kids get? kind of any thoughts you have there.","So I suppose really my only experience of it is in adults. And so, and personal experience, that it's completely debilitating. So when people say, you know, they've been off work for a few days and come back and say ""I've had flu."" No, they haven't they've had cold. Because anybody who's really had flu knows it's, it's nasty, it completely wipes you out. And actually it's not just when you first aquire it, you know actually take a few, few days to recover just your physical strength. Because when I've had it, I think I've only had it twice in me life, which I've been pretty lucky, and I'd been wiped out for a couple weeks. And so, you know, I appreciate the seriousness of it. I've not had any underlying health conditions. So I don't, I've never considered it is dangerous for me. But equally, I wouldn't like my elderly parents have both at heart conditions to get it. And so I do recognize that it can be quite serious. I don't know if it's deadly if I'm honest. I guess there are strains of the flu, like you know different epidemics and pandemics in, and in history, where they have been nasty like Spanish flu and all of that. But I don't know if, I don't know if they're just special strains or individual strains or if they were like what I would consider 'normal flu'. Is deadly to a healthy person. But should I be sayin that, given where we are at the moment? Me own husband's been in intensive care with this one. So."
ts5_19,"My goodness, wow.","So, you know, we take it serious."
ts5_20,"Yeah. And has your, has your husband recovered? Is he doing a bit better now?","Yeah, he's fine now. He was in during Easter, over the Easter weekend. He was in hospital but he, he caught this virus. And we both had it up. I finished work when I first stoped work. Ah, stopped when I first started remote work, and I had it. But I was ok, and then [Husband] got it just after me. And he just went rapidly downhill there he was, could absolutely, could not breathe. I ended up, because my manager at work is [Manager]. And [Manager] was ringing me up at home sayin ""Hows his breathing? Hows that? [Manager] at the finish said that, ""if you see any, any change in his breathing you must ring 999"". And that afternoon I came up, he was asleep and then about 20 minutes later I went in the room and he just couldn't breath at all. So I rang 999 and they took him literally straght in and then he was in intensive care for two weeks."
ts5_21,"Wow. Well, I'm, I'm so glad to hear that he's alright and that you were too.","Absolutely fine, he's fine now."
ts5_22,That that is terrible.,"Yeah, so really we take flu very seriously in our house."
ts5_23,"I'm sure. I'm sure that, I'm sure that when you have a, you know, a respiratory disease like that. And it's, it gets so serious that you've been in hospital, you wouldn't want to take any chances with anything ever again.","No. But in fairness, we would have taken it seriously before that happened. That's just another example of you know, ""right okay, in future we'll be very, very careful."" So, yeah."
ts5_24,"Yeah. Um, so kind of similarly, is flu something you worry about your children getting? Or is it mostly something you worry about for adults?","To be honest, I've never really thought about children gettin flu and how, how badly they would get it. I would, you know, I don't know. You know, you never know if they're going to have underlying health conditions like asthma or something like that. So take it seriously. I mean, when they've had colds, you can tell the difference, can't you? When they're not well, you can see that they're headachey, that they're wingey. Or they get a cold and it's just a little, you get the traditional green candle kind of thing and so you can tell the difference. But I've never, you know when they've been unwell I've never considered it to be flu, just been unwell normally or been something else viral, not the flu. But I don't know about in terms of children, I don't know if children can get proper flu. But then theres flu vaccination for them, so they must."
ts5_25,"Yeah, so would you, like can you, like, can you imagine what you think, if you were looking at one of your children. They're getting sick. What sort of things would you expect to see if they were getting flu or would you not really know what to look for?","Uhm I would be looking for them, or listening for them telling me they had any headaches and you tend to be able to tell right away if they're feeling wingey. You know, your north or clingy and unwell.Temperature. Definitely. You can always tell when the start getting a temperature, visibly before getting a thermometer out. You can tell quite easily. But you just look for the kind of, you just know they're not themselves. They might be a lot more lethargic, they be complaining that things are hurting. Like I say, headaches. I would be giving them calpol. That's probably the steadfast cure for everything, a bit of calpol. Just give them a bit of calpol and put them to bed. And would be my, you know thats my observations of what we do with them anyway."
ts5_26,"Yeah, I've heard from from so many parents that with children of this age, it's so much more about like interpreting what you see, rather than having them tell you. So do you know anyone whose child has gotten seriously ill with the flu or has gotten the flu?",No I don't.
ts5_27,"Yeah. If you want to learn about a sickness, like the flu or, you know, another kind of illness like that, where would you go to get that information? So if you want to learn like symptoms or how to treat it at home like that kind of stuff.","So I use the NHS net. I just go on the internet. Normally it will point you through. It obviously picks up a lot of American websites. WebMD often comes up as one of them. I tend to go to the NHS ones because obviously the rules are different in the UK as to what you can treat things with. And so I tend to look on on NHS net if if I'm looking for anything on you know, I'm not sure about something, like when they get them, you know, a strange rash appears on them, I go on there to see if I can find out what it looks like and that kind of thing."
ts5_28,Yeah. Have you ever talked to your child's GP about the flu or to any other medical professional about flu and how it could affect your child?,"We, so talking to the less than, well no. We have had correspondence from the school and from uh, that must be the health visitor actually. They write to you when they're due for the checks and they point out, you know, the, the reasons why you should get your child vaccinated. So I haven't actually had a conversation with them about it other than once I've gone into the surgery with them."
ts5_29,"That's great. Um, so what do you think the benefits are of having your child get the flu vaccine?","Um, so I do understand that when they get the vaccine, it's not necessarily a guarantee they wont get flu, but it vastly reduces the possibility that they will. I also have a kind of underlying hope that if they've had the vaccine and the do get flu they wont have it as badly."
ts5_30,Mm hmm.,"I don't know. I don't know if I'm just being optimistic there. So yeah, then the two things I think that they won't get the flu. Therefore, we'll have a healthier household, you know all fit well and we can carry on life as normal. So for them, they're not sick. Because of, you know, I don't particularly want them to get sick, but also for us it's, it's, it means your life and continue on as normally. You don't miss out on school and all the learning opportunities because [Younger Child] is just in nursery. And we don't miss out on work because if one gets it, then we would all have it."
ts5_31,"Yeah, I think especially for parents of young children. It sounds like one of the benefits people see tends to be that, you know, sick kid isn't just unfortunate because your child is sick. It's unfortunate because as long as they're sick, there's going to be this major disruption to you're going to work and all that.","And then they pass it on, and it goes through the family, so it has a, you know, has a much bigger effect."
ts5_32,"Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. So it's not just, you know, one or two weeks it's two weeks times how many people you have in house.","Oh yeah. And with something like flu. It's not something you can, say if you know, like us, We're quite lucky that we've got grandparents who will help look after them. Now if one of mine have flu, I would not give them to my parents to look after because they're elderly. So I would take the time off and stay at home, and whereas if they have something like chicken pox, you can because parents have had chicken pox, shingles, all that, you know. So they're through all that, they're immune. But I wouldn't do that with them with something like flu where they're, when the risk of them getting it, it would be very serious."
ts5_33,"Yeah, that's an interesting point. So it sounds like there would be maybe a little bit less, you would feel like you had a little bit less opportunity for familial support with flu?","You know you can send them with a tummy upset or something like that. But you gotta be, you know, when you've got elderly parents, you have to be quite careful. So you do rely less of course. Yeah, you just rely less on your family for that kind of thing. Yeah."
ts5_34,"Yeah, um, do you think there are downsides to having your child get the flu vaccine and what would those downsides be?","Um, I don't think there's a downside to it. If I'm honest, it was. It's interesting because I know this is about [Younger Child]'s age each group. Now [Younger Child], [Younger Child] did have an injection. Pretty sure she did have an injection but [Older Child] had a just a nose spray. So I don't know why the difference because and [Older Child] got has done at school and but [Younger Child] has done at the GP surgery by the nurse. And I'm sure when I think back, I'm sure she had a vaccination. So the momentary discomfort of having the vaccination I think. And the benefits of that vastly outweigh, so I don't really see it as a problem and I don't believe there are any long term effects from it because it was all explained to me when she had the injection, that the virus that was given, it was dead, and that she would should not have any symptoms. If she had anything that would be no more than a bit of a temperature for a couple of hours maybe up to 48 hours after should originally had it. So I didn't see any of that as as negatives for her."
ts5_35,Yeah. So it sounds like what you're saying is that you thought there were overwhelming benefits that outweighed some minor downsides. Is that accurate?,Definitely.
ts5_36,"Yeah. So when you want to learn more about a vaccine, like the flu vaccine or any vaccination, Like if it should be given your child, what benefits it would have for your child, what side effects it could have, where would you go to get that information?","Uhm probably the practice, me GP practice. I will do a little bit of searching online. But often, often for things like that. You've got to have a very practical mindset. I think sometimes you can scare yourself off to death when you read things online. So if I have any concerns, I would ask the doctor."
ts5_37,Have you ever talked to your child's GP about the flu vaccine. The flu vaccine specifically?,"Not about the flu vaccine. I went to talk to the practice nurse when I went in. So she, you know before I actually let her have the vaccine. Had a chat with her about it, she explained, like I say, all about the you know, the virus actually being dead and shouldn't have any side effects for her. So I didn't talk to the GP but I talked to the practice nurse."
ts5_38,"Yeah. And did she When you you know when you brought [Younger Child] into the practice for the vaccine. Did you have those questions, or is that information or it's just kind of provided to you as standard course for the appointment.","It was provided a standard course, I didnt, because I've read, you know, read around it before I took her in and I didn't really have any additional questions. It was just the information sheet provided. But what I didn't realize was, you know, when they talk about no side effects. The reason why. And because it's not a live virus that they're given them so it shouldn't, I just hadn't appreciated that I suppose."
ts5_39,"Yeah. So, [Younger Child] was vaccinated. How important was it to you that she be vaccinated for the flu? Was it something that, you know, as soon as you learned she was eligible you were picking up the phone to make an appointment? Or was it something where you were more like ""well you know, if it happens, it happens"". Can you give me a sense for that?","So as soon as the University said, we could have the vaccinations. I was probably one of the first ones to sign on it. I wanted it. Because [Husband] had it a couple of years ago and he was really poorly with it. And so I think I've just got practical mindset about it. Lili was having it at school and I signed her up when we went for the family introduction, I signed up there and then for it. And so she got it through them and I didn't have to worry about her. But I didn't know how I was going to get [Younger Child] done. Then I just got a letter from the surgery, they got in touch with me  and said, you know, ""she's eligible, do you want to have it?"" and I took her straight down and got it done. And so I didn't need to really look into it. As such, it was the office, were there for me and I took, took opportunity, the opportunity that was there. I would have gotten it, you know, even if that opportunity hadn't come along, because she goes to nursery and if there's flu going round the nursery I don't want her picking it up. So I would have explored it meself had that offer not come in at the time it did."
ts5_40,"Yeah, that makes sense. So once you decided, you know once you have the letter and you decided okay You know, we're going to get, get you the flu vaccine. How easy was the process from there? Can you kind of walk me through what it looked like. Was it just a phone call and then you had an appointment. You brought her in, or was it a bit more complicated?","Oh, that was exactly it. We got an appointment. We just rang up and explained that we were taken her in for a vaccination and they just gave us an appointment. I worked that around work, I had to finish early to take her down, which is fine. I picked her up from nursery and took her down. It was no, not difficult at all. It was a very easy process."
ts5_41,"Yeah, great. Do you remember what month it was at all, was it in the fall more in the winter?","Think it was October, November time"
ts5_42,"Sure, yeah, that's great. So that, yes, that's kind of all my questions on that subject. So I do have a few other questions that are just kind of to help me learn our thoughts surrounding vaccination as a whole. Has your child receives any other vaccinations, like the kind of standard course of vaccinations.","Yes, she's had them all."
ts5_43,Yeah. And how did you decide that she should receive those vaccinations was that something you researched? Was it something you talked about? Or maybe you didn't feel like you needed to do much at all?,"The only one I  had any reservations about was the MMR  vaccination, just because its had all that,  a few years ago there was all that and discussion about whether it's caused autism. It's the only vaccination actually that she's had a reaction to."
ts5_44,"Oh, really?","Yeah, no, Lili didn't have any reactions at all. But [Younger Child], I had a bit of a funny experience about 48 hours after she had it. She went all, not quite floppy but very, like wobbly, she just couldn't really control her muscles very well. And that only lasted a few hours we consulted with the doctor at the time. So that was the only one I had any real reservations about, but we still went ahead and got it done, but when she was old enough to... I'm against I suppose, having them to young."
ts5_45,Mm hmm.,"And she only had it about, maybe four weeks ago, and she's nearly four. So waited a bit until she got that one."
ts5_46,"Yeah, so can you, like, it sounds like that there was some consideration about whether or not that was a good idea. Did you do. Like, were you talking to the GP about that or is that research you were doing independently that you kind of, when you were deciding whether or not she would receive it, if she would receive it late. You know, where we kind of doing that research?","Independent research so looking online, getting some statistics, but also talking to other parents. And of course we were starting to the measles outbreaks again in the region. So, knowing that I didn't want to get it and of course, my husband's very pro vaccine, he was well up for it. So, it was me that was reserved about it. But we just, when they first contacted, contacted us several, or a few months ago now, and we just delayed it. We just waited until, up until actually just a few weeks ago and took her down. We waited until we were at home full time to watch exactly what happened to her. I felt more comfortable with that then had I done and then put her into nursery and she was with somebody else saying ""oh she doesn't look very well"" When we we were at home with her we could actually monitor her. I'm glad we did because, like I say, she did have a reaction to it."
ts5_47,"Yeah, so that was that kind of the deciding element was having her home so that you could supervise her more closely? Or do you think it was something were already going to do and that was just the opportunity that arose?","We, I would have done it anyway. I'm just glad I was at home. It was a good opportunity to have it done. When I was, I think, if I'd had it done and I've been at work I probably would have asked me mum to look after her for a couple of days. I might've take her out of nursery just to make sure that in the first 48 hours she was okay. Because the people who know them best will spot any symptoms and would get you straight away if they thought that they were unwell. So I think I would have probably still got it done, but I would have probably got someone to look after her other than the nursery."
ts5_48,"Sure. Was there, you know, was there a thing that made you just you over the edge from ""I'm not so sure about this"" too ""Okay, She'll get the vaccine""? You know, is that, or was that sort of the product of the research that you had been doing and thinking about the vaccine?","No, I just satisfied meself that the risks were low. And of course, she is a bit older now, because three and a half [inaudible] and or again. So we would we would be, it would be very obvious if she should have an adverse reaction to it. But I think being a bit older, she was more able to, her body was more able to cope with it. That was my thoughts on it. So a lot was I just satisfied meself really that the risks were low."
ts5_49,"Yeah so similar to what you had said about the flu vaccine and that you sort of looked at the benefits that it offered. They seemed, you know, pretty substantial. You mentioned, you know, that measles was circulating again and that it kind of worried you but the side effects or the risks were maybe a little higher with the MMR vaccine thane flu vaccine is that sort of how you were thinking? But eventually the benefits outweighed the risks?",Mhmm yes. Yeah.
ts5_50,"So that's great. Thank you for kind of walking me through that. Um, have you had the flu vaccine this year?","Have I had it? Yes, yeah yeah."
ts5_51,"Yeah, and that was, as far as deciding to do that, was because, I think as we were talking earlier you mentioned that you have had the flu and your husband has has had flu. So just not wanting to get the flu.","I didn't want to get it and I've never had a flu vaccine before. But having John, I'm sorry I'm pointing over there, Just knowning John had it a couple years ago. As a family, I just don't want us to get flu. If we can avoid it. I'd rather not have it."
ts5_52,Mm hmm.,"Interestingly John's, the only one in the family who didn't get it. I think I'm just a bit more proactive maybe. Got the kids, got meself done. Just protecting yourself really."
ts5_53,"So that was the last question, but the thing I like to sort of close on. Is there anything about the flu, or about the flu vaccine, or vaccination in general, or just anything that I didn't ask about that you were hoping I would ask about that you want to talk about before we kind of finish things off here.","Um, I don't think so. I think, you know, it's only while I was thinking about the vaccine and an understanding maybe why one got the nasal spray vaccine and the other one got the injection. I have no idea why there was a difference there. And I don't expect you to have an answer to that, but it would just be interesting to find out, you know, why they do that. Because I would have thought all children, maybe would have had the nasal and inhale, inhale it, rather than have a vaccine, but I don't know why they do it that way."
ts5_54,"Yeah, um, you know, I, I don't know the exact answer. I know that.The NHS and Public Health England recommend the injection for children up to including three year olds and younger. And once they get into school they recommend the nasal spray from age four to 16.","Oh, well that explains it."
ts5_55,Yeah.,Right.
ts5_56,"Thats what it says on the NHS website so, you know, that's kind of all I know about as far as why they have those recommendations and why they have the different kind of vaccine types. I'm not sure.","That was, that was it really that was the only curious point"
ts5_57,"Yeah, no, it is, it is interesting, I think, especially when you have to, you know, two children, very close in age and they say to do one thing for one and one thing for the other. I can see that that's strange,  to hear that.","And of course it didn't ask the doctor, the nurse at the time did I?"
ts10_0,"Alright so what we'll start with is I'm going to read you a series of statements. That are. It's a consent process. So it's basically just making sure that you understand what we're doing and that we have your permission for you to take part in the study. So I'm going to read you each of these statements and I'll just ask that you say either yes or I agree, or no, I don't agree to each one.",All right.
ts10_1,"Okay, yeah. Alright, so the first one I confirm that I've read the information sheet for this study. I've had the opportunity to consider the information to ask questions and have had these questions answered satisfactorily.",Yes.
ts10_2,"All right, I understand my participation is voluntary, and that I am free to withdraw it anytime without giving any reason. I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview.",Yes.
ts10_3,I understand that information collected during my interview may be looked at by other researchers from Newcastle University. Who are working on or assisting with the study I give permission for these individuals to have access to this information.,Yeah.
ts10_4,I understand that information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for use in future research or teaching purposes that the data will be thoroughly anonymized first,Yeah.
ts10_5,I understand that the interview will be audio video recorded according to my preference typed out and that all my identifying personal details will be removed.,Yes.
ts10_6,"I understand the direct quotations may be taken from what I say and used in future research and publications, but I will not be identifiable from these quotations.","Yeah,"
ts10_7,I agree to take part in this study.,"Yes, I agree."
ts10_8,"Excellent. There's just two other things. If you'd like to receive a copy of the research findings. When the study is completed. You can either let me know now, or email me after the fact and I'd be happy to send those to you.",Oh yes please. That sounds interesting that would be good.
ts10_9,"Yeah, absolutely. So the study will be completed. Towards the end of August, so you can expect to see that to your email address around that time. Yeah. And if you'd like to receive a hard copy of the study documents you can let me know. Now I would mail those to you, but I would need your mailing address to do that.",And I think just an email. Will it be the same by email?
ts10_10,"Alright, so that's all that out of the way so we can go ahead and get started here. And you have two children. Is that right?",I do. Yeah.
ts10_11,Yeah. And how old are they?,They are two and five.
ts10_12,"Yeah. Um, so the five year old has started school then right?",She has yeah she started last September.
ts10_13,"Yeah, how was how was she liking it?","Um yeah, it took her a few weeks to um, before she settled. Now obviously she's still off and has been for a few months. And I think she'll be okay when she goes back."
ts10_14,"Yeah. And how are, how are things going with having the kids at home all the time now?","Um okay. It's just been an adjustment because I am, I was working. But then it was a seasonal contract and it was like a heritage site. And so obviously we didn't open for this season. So I'm at home and my husband's working from home. So I'm kind of a stay at home mum now, which wasn't really my plan, but I'm, it's, yeah, it's okay. We're lucky. Oh my god. And we've got, you know, woods and lots of land near us which is good."
ts10_15,"Yeah, it's nice to have some outdoor access, but I think that, you know, if you're if you're doing okay this year you're doing the best you can. So I think that's kind of the most we can ask for at this point.","Yeah, yeah."
ts10_16,So can you tell me a little bit about your children like what are their names are kind of things do they like to do just any you know anything?,"[Older child] is the elder, she's five and [Younger child] is two and and they like all sorts. You know being outside and lots of like messy play and discovering things and they love seeing their family and their grandparents and um, the younger, [Younger child], likes dolls and cars and things like that. Whereas [Older child] likes drawing and art and those kinds of things."
ts10_17,"Yeah, very cool. So can you tell me what you know about the flu. So just sort of your first impressions when you hear the word flu. You know what kind of symptoms do you think of? Is it a serious illness? You know, what can you tell me about the flu?","Well, I always think, you always, sometimes people tend to think that it's just a more severe cold and then I hear people say, ""oh, well, if you think it's just a cold you haven't had it and it's much worse than all that"" so I don't know if I've ever had it. Um, but yeah, I know that you can children can be immunized. And if you work in certain fields you're immunized. I used to work in social housing with over 55s so I was entitled to an immunization at work. Yeah I know that it, that it's responsible for however many deaths a year and and that's what you know the figures, people were throwning around when they saw coronavirus and you know ""can't be that bad in comparison to the regular flu"". But yeah that's as much as I know really. Obviously when I was pregnant I was immunized and With the flu. But apart from that for myself, it's not a regular thing. My husband's offered his at work so he gets it and and yeah I guess it's I, I just, I suppose, is normalized in a way. Um, but with the kids and they do get their immunizations. Usually."
ts10_18,"Yeah, so has, your older daughter that's [Older child] right? Yeah, yeah. So did [Older child] received the flu vaccine this year. Do you remember?","She did yeah, at school, she had this spray up her nose."
ts10_19,And [Younger child] did not have it. Is that right?,She didn't. I think it's hard to remember that far back because I was finishing my dissertation around that time and and I think she was offered at the local clinic of doctors. But I think it clashed and she was either a nursery or she was being looked after by my mom and I couldn't get to the doctors and I think she missed the window for it.
ts10_20,Sure.,"So that was my negligence really. But this year, I will, you know, see what everything's going on. I'll make an effort to get there. And, but I think it was more of an open clinic. I think they changed their and their way of doing it, so it was like a window that I had to get there. And I wasn't able to make it."
ts10_21,"Yeah, so it was rather than like making an appointment. It was like, you can bring her in, you know, at this time, and she'll be seen?",Yeah.
ts10_22,"Sure. Um, so do you. When you think about the flu in children. Would you worry about one of your children getting the flu? I mean, of course you don't, you know, nobody ever wants their child to get. But is it something that if you realize she was coming down with it, would you, you know, would that make you any more worried than any other illness or not really?","I don't think so. No, it wouldn't be really, I mean obviously now with coronavirus and all the things you hear about different strains and possibilities of mutations and all that. I mean, I don't, I'm not an expert on it, but I. No, I think I wouldn't be too concerned. [Older child] when she was about 18 months, she had pneumonia and she had to stay in hospital. So I suppose I'd be worried that she'd be more susceptible to chest infections and things. I think the smaller they are, although [Younger child] is quite robust now she's having a bit of a growth spurt, but when they're, you know, when they're smaller and more fragile you do worry. And but they do both seem quite hardy and then they both had chicken pox. And, you know, all sorts of illnesses. I'm sorry. No, I think wrongly or rightly, I don't think I'd be too concerned. No."
ts10_23,"Yeah sure. No, that that makes sense to me. I mean, it sounds like they've been aside from [Older child] with her pneumonia, it sounds like they're generally healthy. I can see why, you know, you wouldn't be, wouldn't be super worried. So can you explain to me what you think getting sick with the flu is like for children? Are there any specific symptoms that come to mind? If you don't know, that's fine too. Just, you know, if one of your daughters was going to come down with flu, what sorts of things would you expect to see happening?","Um, well, I know that the adults experience and chills and sweats and shakes. And, I think, is it nausea and headaches as well? I don't know if there's any difference. I haven't, I haven't looked up or, um seen any, you know, you read pamphlets and the doctors. I haven't discovered if there's any differences between children. So I wouldn't know. I suppose what we do do when they get a little ill, we do, we got Dr. Google. So then when they are ill and so yeah, I don't know if there's any distinct difference between children and adults getting it."
ts10_24,"Yeah, sure. Um, so that's actually one of my next questions here is when you want to learn more about a sickness, like the flu, where would you go to get that information? So, you know, you mentioned searching online. Can you, is there specific websites or resources that you use or is it just, you know, kind of typing the symptoms and see what comes up?","Yeah, I think, to begin with, probably type in the symptoms and then definitely refer to the NHS website. I mean you kind of have a good idea which websites are to be trusted. And you know which ones, know more than others and and then when it if something was to be serious, we have phoned the 111 before when [Older child] was younger. I think we kind of have a bit more experience now like we know a bit more now. But um yeah, those are, those kind of things that we would do. And then also, family members, and you know, get your second opinion from your mum if you're not sure. And if it's not an emergency. Then also, also they have the health visitor on hand, but we haven't really seen ours for a while. I think, usually when you've got your first child and you're kind of not too sure what you're doing you speak to the health visitor. And then once you have another one you just, you know, you just let them raise themselves."
ts10_25,"Yeah. You've done it all once before, you're basically an expert at that point.",Yeah
ts10_26,"Yeah. So it sounds like from what you're saying that if it was just kind of general interest learning you'd be using, you know, the internet and the NHS website. But if it was something that felt urgent or that you were worried about, that's when you would be more inclined to call 111. Is that, am I understanding correctly?","Yeah, there's been a few times when Violent was ill and was quite ill throughout the night and and you know when it's night time, it feels so much worse. I think when she had a really high temperature and it wouldn't go down and she... yeah, she had to be taken to the doctors in the end, some... I think it was an infection or something. But yeah, at night we would call 111 more. I know. In fact, the other week. [Younger child] was given sugar free jelly sweets by my mum who thought they were healthy because they were sugar free, but obviously they cause sickness and diarrhea and she just turned white. I didn't know what was wrong with her. I think she's so small she um, yeah, it affected her really badly. But see, I mean she expelled it all. Was immediately fine afterwards and but that yeah we were on the on the brink of calling 111 because she just she kind of collapsed and she went all white in the face."
ts10_27,"Wow, yeah. I'm glad she was okay. That sounds like it was a pretty scary situation.","I think because she couldn't tell us what was wrong and you know you just kind of think the worst. And because she went blue in the lips, and I know that could be a lack of oxygen. But yeah, it was just sweets."
ts10_28,"Well, I'm glad that that had an easy resolution.",Yeah absolutely.
ts10_29,"Yeah, so have you ever talked to your, like one of your children's GP or the health visitor about flu specifically? Or has it always just been kind of more general, you've never brought it up?","Yeah, more general. I don't think they've ever targeted. I don't think they've ever said, you know, the flu. They might have said it in a general way, but I don't think they've said these are the symptoms for children and and these are the statistics and risks. I think it's been accepted that it's one of those things that it's just offered and that you just got without complaints."
ts10_30,"So does flu, like when you think about flu, does it seem to you like something you think of as avoidable? or is it something that just feels sort of inevitable, like, you know, children are going to get the flu, just like they're going to get any other illness?","Um, I think. See, I don't know for children, I would think possibly for adults that its just inevitable but I never, I've never really thought of children and getting the flu before. Just like the regular coughs and colds. I mean, when they both started going to nursery. They were 18 months to two years old, and especially [Older child], she was loaded with colds and for like the next four months.She, she just constantly got colds and I would take it to the doctors and the chest infections and and they said, you know, ""it's not, this is not, one's viral and one's bacterial but it's not whatever needs treatment"" and and then on the sixth time I took her in it was a chest infection. That was when she got taken into hospital for pneumonia, but I think, yeah, you just accept that they'd get lots of colds and simple. And I've never, I've, you know, I've never thought of them having it, being you know debilitated by the flu before. I've never really thought its something children get. But then I suppose they do get because you immunized against it. I don't know how effective the immunizations are, I guess I've just accepted that it's just a good, sensible thing to to allow them to have done."
ts10_31,"Yeah, absolutely. So what do you think like the benefits are of having your child get the flu vaccine or are there any benefits or  have you never maybe thought about benefits before? Can you speak to that a little bit?","Well, I've probably never given it the time properly to think about it, other than just hoping that it would minimize their risk of contracting it."
ts10_32,Yeah.,"Yeah, that's all. I've never really stopped to think. Um I know that it and, well, there's no negative side effects that I've been told of, just low, you know, relativley low risk and and that it will prevent them from getting it. So I guess that's all I've thought about it."
ts10_33,"Yeah, I mean, those are, sounds like some benefits to me. So you sort of spoke to this a little bit, but I'm curious, maybe a little more broadly. Do you think there are downsides to getting the flu vaccine? And when I, when I say downsides, that can be side effects, adverse reactions or whatever. But it could also be, you know anything else, whether it's the inconvenience, the children don't like it, you know, kind of any downsides, you can think of. Do you think there are downsides and if there are, what would they be?","Um I don't. Yeah, as I said, probably. I'm sure there will be, you know, one in however many chances of getting side effects and because there's always side effects aren't there? But I suppose the greater good outweighs it. With the discomfort, [Older child] when she got the nasal spray. I mean, they would have had it explained. I think, a letter came home and I said to her, you know, ""this is going to happen and this is why you need it"". And and then they would have obviously said it again at school. I think because all of her peers were getting it was probably a bit exciting and they were she was mentioned it before actually because I told her about this. And she said, ""Oh, yeah, I have my spray and you get given a tissue afterwards to wipe your nose"" and so I think it's probably good to teach them that discomfort, things like that, you know, you need your vaccinations and, and I guess yeah the inconvenience of having to schedule appointments and I mean I, yeah, kind of, um, should have taken [Younger child], should have organized my time, but I was all wrapped up in the dissertation. So yeah, and I guess that's it, it's not really an area that I'm knowledgeable in I guess. I've just accepted that it's, you know, it's done for a good reason. And just get on with it."
ts10_34,"Yeah well and that you know that is that's a perfectly valid answer to you certainly don't need to be an expert in, you know, this kind of thing. It's perfectly reasonable to just, you know, kind of accept it and get on to all the other things. Parents are busy people, they certainly don't need to be, you know, trying to become an expert in everything by any means.","Yeah, I think it's just widely accepted that it's just one of those things. And it's, yeah, it's not really viewed as anything sinister. So yeah Yeah."
ts10_35,"So to you. It sort of sounds like if I'm understanding correctly. It's that you have the sense that this decision, you know, kind of weighing the benefits weighing the risks, all that stuff all those decisions have been made sort of by other people and you Sort of trust, trust in a sense, that those decisions are the right ones. And so you're willing to go along with that is that, does that seem fair to say?","Yeah. Yeah, no, that's right. I think I might read around it a bit more now. But I think. Yeah, and I think is. Yeah, that's right. Um Yeah, I feel foolish now because I usually read into things but and I think yeah because generations of just accepted it and that it's kind of like norm, isn't it, that you just and and like I say, I've, I've never seen any met anyone with really bad effects from it."
ts10_36,"Yeah no, the point is not to make you feel foolish at all. So, so please don't feel like you know I'm expecting you to have a very comprehensive accurate answers to these things, you know, part of what what we're trying to learn is what parents now and if parents don't know all that much about it that's an interesting finding too. So don't feel like you were supposed to be an expert coming into this because thats definitely not the case. And I think sometimes, too.You know when it's something about your child's health, it's, it's important to know what you do and what you don't know. And you're not, you don't need to be an expert in all of these things.",Yeah.
ts10_37,"So if you want to learn more about a vaccine, you know, anything like who its recommended for, you know, what does it do all that kind of stuff. Where would you go to get that information and where have you gotten that information past?","When they are younger, and then they get all their um, like the MMR and all the different immunisations that they're given in the first year. You get a lot of pamphlets from the health visitor and from the GP and you get the red book, the log book and and there's lots of information there. So that was um yeah that's primarily where I would get it from."
ts10_38,"Yeah, sure. So, so things, it would be information provided by the GP right?",Yeah. Yeah.
ts10_39,"Yeah, or. And you also mentioned for your, for your older daughter, it was a letter sent back from the school, but it was about the in school program.",Yeah.
ts10_40,"Yeah, yeah. Um, so you mentioned for these kind of next couple questions, talking about [Younger child] specifically, you mentioned that she had not received the flu vaccine this year is that right? In this past fall, is that right?","Yeah, that's right."
ts10_41,"Yeah, so I think you spoke to this a little bit before but I just want to make sure that, you know, I kind of understand correctly. My question is, how important was it to you that she not receive the flu vaccine was it something that you were like, you know, ""no that's not a good option for her. We're not going to do it, or was it something that was more like, Well, you know, we'll see what happens""?","Um, yeah, I think rather we'd see what happens. I think, I'm not against having it. I would. It was really just a logistics thing that I that she was either. I can't remember that far back. She was either in nursery or she was with my mom for the day and so I didn't ask her to take her because I thought it'd be more inconvenient for her and. And yeah, so it was just a scheduling thing really and I, my husband was a bit annoyed because he was like, ""Oh, she should have it. You know, it's important for them"" and but I. Yeah, so he, as I  said he has his every year at work. And so he probably feels it's more important for them but I it's kind of like a bonus. I thought that she would get it and because, as I said I'm not that I'm, you know, knowledgeable about it. I just wasn't sure the risks of children getting it. So it really was like, if I could have made it, I would have taken her. And I definitely will this year, this has made me think I will take the initiative. But yeah, that was it, just scheduling."
ts10_42,"Yeah, no I that that makes sense to me. I think, you know, especially for parents with multiple children and you were working on, you know, your dissertation. It's people get busy, things get prioritized and you know sometimes just the way it works out some things are not going to happen. Um, I'm curious when you have. Can you walk me through the process of how you learned that she was eligible was it, I think you said something about a letter? Was that link an invitation from the GP or something else? How did that work?","It was. Yeah, it was an invitation, um, I think what it was was I think initially they did give me an appointment. and I phoned and I said ""I can't make this. Can we reschedule it?"" and they said, ""Oh, well, there's a we're just doing clinics now."" And so they wouldn't give me another appointment. It was like, something like eight until 11 and, you know, on a Thursday morning or whenever. And there's, where I live there's, we go to like a branch of GPs. So it's, so there's one about a mile away. There's one in the village that we live in and which is open for less hours. So it depends, you know, which one you get an appointment at and we're lucky, we've got, you know, a car. So we don't need to rely on the bus. So, um, yeah. So it was just the timing really."
ts10_43,"Yeah, just it just wasn't time that worked.",Yeah
ts10_44,"So it sounds like there were, you know, you were given one time and that time wasn't convenient for you. And then the second opportunity was also not convenient. So it was there was not a lot of opportunity to make it happen. It was just these two options. And if it didn't happen then than it wasn't going to happen.","Yeah, they tend to do that with a lot of the baby, things like the baby clinics on a specific morning every week. Um, well, I mean, obviously it's, you know, the, yeah. The service is a good and that it's limited by the staff and the premises that they have, so it's no one's fault really. But it, yeah, when I was at uni and I and I was working as well so it was hard to fit everything in. And, um, but, yeah, so that's really, that's just what happened."
ts10_45,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, so my next few questions are just kind of that helped me learn your thoughts about vaccination like in general. So have your children received any of their other vaccinations, like, you know, the standard childhood vaccinations?","Yeah, yeah. They're all up to date with those."
ts10_46,"Yeah, um, and can you explain how you decided that they would receive those vaccinations, or did you feel like there was a decision to be made there at all?","Um, I think, yeah, I think I just accepted that they were, um, you know, it was in their best interest and and obviously I'd had them and my husband had them and my siblings and everyone that I know and I've had them. And, and whats the one? It's measles that yeah they can't be vaccinated until a certain age, so it was. And, you know, you see other cases, really, you know, horror stories about babies catching these things and they're not been able to fight infections off. So I think I just thought, just acknowledged that it was for the best. I mean it is yeah, especially when with your first one, and they're so small and they don't like it. But they don't remember it and yeah, you just accept that its in their best interest."
ts10_47,"Yeah, yeah. Absolutely, --","Sorry, I was just gonna say that the nurses and the doctors that give them, they, they acknowledge that you might be apprehensive, and they do answer the questions they sit with you. So that's another like reassurance from them as well."
ts10_48,"Yeah, that's nice. That sort of transparency, maybe the willingness to talk about it can be helpful you think?",Yeah yeah
ts10_49,"Yeah, um, and have you personally had the flu vaccine this year?","Um, what was I doing last year? No, because I was in a different job and no, it wasn't offered to me. And, and I wasn't sure if I was eligible, actually. And my husband seems to think I would be and that you just go out and ask to have it done. But I, it wasn't really, it's not really on my radar. But as I say after this I might pay a bit more attention and might get it done."
ts10_50,"Yeah, so that's actually, that's all of my questions. So the kind of the thing that I like to close on is just, is there anything about the flu or the flu vaccine or vaccination in general on anything you were hoping I've asked about that. I didn't that you'd like to speak to?","Um, no, I don't think so, because I didn't really have any prior knowledge and other than just accepting it was a kind of a, you know, a thing that happens and it was a good thing that you've got this extra protection for the most vulnerable people. So I think I thought that children and mostly I knew that older people at my old work those over 55s were given it and and then people and that might, you know, be vulnerable need it. But it's, yeah, it's not really anything it's it's not usually at the forefront of my mind really."
ts10_51,"Yeah, something it's something that you think of mostly as like a problem for older adults or people with, you know, severe medical conditions. But because you and your family, don't fall into that category. It just isn't something you had really given much thought to is that does that sound right?","Yeah. And also I think because, because of this whole ""oh if you've never had flu. You don't know that you've had it, you've haven't had it"" kind of mentality and and then when people will do complain and say, ""oh, I think I've got the flu"" and and everyone else says ""It's not that bad"". It's supposed to be this terrible thing, so I think when I have felt really ill I think, ""is that bad enough to be the flu?"" So I don't think I've had it. I'm not, so I guess it's just, it's just something that I assume you just get any usually get over. You know, if you're young enough and and health enough and so it's just something really to be endured. And it's just like a kind of illness that you just get and get over. Obviously there's complications with other people. Um, but touch word I think hopefully we would be okay."
ts10_52,"Yeah, so it's yeah that makes sense to me. That's interesting that sort of the you know all the talk about. Because I've heard people say that exact same thing that if you, you know, ""if you think you had the flu. You didn't have the flu. Because if you did, you know."" I kind of, that almost sort of makes you think, like, Well, I don't know, you know, maybe I maybe I have had it. Maybe I never have. Maybe it's a big deal. Maybe it is. It pushes you away from thinking about it a little more.",Yeah.
ts10_53,"Yeah, that's, that's a really interesting point that thanks for thanks for bringing that up. That's interesting. So that, like I said that my last question. So unless there's anything else that you wanted to add. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording now.","No, that's, that's all"
ts11_0,"Alright, so the first thing we'll start with is just a consent process. I'm going to read you a series of statements and I'll just ask you to say yes or no to each one. Its a little bit repetitive towards the end. My apologies. I confirm that I have read the information sheet for this study. I've had the opportunity to consider the information to ask questions and have had these questions answered satisfactorily.",Yeah.
ts11_1,"I understand that my participation is voluntary, and that I am free to withdraw it anytime without giving any reason. I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview. Yeah.",Yeah.
ts11_2,I understand that information collected during my interview may be looked at by other researchers from Newcastle University are working on or assisting with the study I give permission for these individuals to have access to this information.,Yeah.
ts11_3,I understand that information collected during my interview may be shared by other-- may be shared with other researchers for use in future research or teaching purposes that the data will be thoroughly anonymized first,Yeah
ts11_4,I understand that the interview will be audio video recorded typed out and that all of my identifying personal details will be removed.,Yes
ts11_5,"Understand that direct quotations may be taken from what I say and used in research and publications, but that I will not be identifiable from these quotations.",Yeah.
ts11_6,I agree to take part in this study.,Yes
ts11_7,"Yeah, excellent. And if you'd like to receive a copy of the research findings, I can send you those once the study is complete, you can either tell me that now, or if you decide you want to see those later. You can email me,","Yeah, no keep me in the loop, that would be pretty good to know. Yeah."
ts11_8,"Yeah, absolutely. So this study will be finished towards the end of August. So that's when you can expect to get that. And the last thing is if you'd like to receive a hard copy of all the study documents I can mail those to you.","No, that's fine. Don't worry."
ts11_9,"Okay. All right, so that's that out of the way we can sort of dive into some other questions here. So my first couple of questions just to help get to know you and your child, a little better and to help me understand what you know about the flu. So you have two children, is that, right?","Yeah, two. That's right."
ts11_10,"Yeah, yeah. And how old are they?","So one has just turned nine and the youngest, [Younger Child], is three, but she will be four in September."
ts11_11,"Great, and are they both girls?","Yeah, they are, yeah."
ts11_12,And how are they doing with lockdown?,"They are interesting with lock down. Surviving there's lots of pictures that get put up behind me and requests for things. But, um, yeah. They're, they're okay to be honest, its one of those joys. I'm less okay. They may have regressed about a year, but."
ts11_13,"Who hasn't at this point? I think, I think children are regressing and adults are aging faster than normal.","Yeah, yeah. Im certainly greyer than I was."
ts11_14,"So has your, your youngest, youngest was named [Younger Child]?","[Younger Child], yeah."
ts11_15,"Yeah. Has she, had, before this year had she started school yet?","So she was in school nursery, so not reception yet, because she's September so she's going to be the oldest. So she's kind of got early entry into nursery and then she officially starts in September. So in a school, but not in school yet."
ts11_16,"Yeah, that makes sense. Has she started back at nursery yet or is she still at home?","No, no. Our school decided that they couldn't keep them apart so they decided they weren't going to open the nursery."
ts11_17,"Yeah, it's too bad.","Yeah. I tried begging, crying, nothing would work."
ts11_18,"Yeah, it's gotta be hard for the kids to just because that you know the social aspect is so important for kids their age.","Yeah, I mean, neither of them are missing the schoolwork side of it, but they're missing their friends. Yeah."
ts11_19,"Yeah, and just just being able to get out of the house and see some different faces is important for everyone.","Yeah, they're bored of me."
ts11_20,So can you tell me what you know about the flu like when you hear the word flu. What are your first impressions?,"Okay, well, I guess I should say that I come from a family of nurses. So I'm one of, my mum is a school nurse. So a lot of my information and things have always come from her. She's my tester for most things. And so with things like the flu vaccine and stuff, she's always kind of gone ""oh flu's horrible.""  You've never, I remember having flu vividly when I was maybe seven or eight. And I remember being really, really sick and having to stay in bed listening to all the kids on the street playing and not been able to go out. So I guess when I think of flu, I think of kind of been stuck in bed really high temperature, aching, and just not being able to do anything. Sorry, she's just given me a request for a vending machine."
ts11_21,"It's worth a shot, she can't have it if she doesn't ask. Um, so you had the flu, when you were a child.","Yeah. Yes, I remember being I remember it being horrible, yeah. I remember having a high temperature. And I remember it being something that meant you couldn't do anything. I kind of will often say, ""Oh, I feel a bit fluey"" now but really, what I mean is, I've got bad cold. So I do use flu as the word to describe a cold, if that makes sense. Even though I know my head. It's not flu. It's just a bad cold."
ts11_22,"Yeah, can you tell me as far as the differences between flu and cold. What are the kind of differences that you think of?","Um, so I guess in my head. I probably think of flu is being debilitating. So if you've got the flu. It's not that you're just being a bit lazy and facny a day in bed, you physically can't get out of bed. You can't concentrate on work. Whereas if you've got cold, you can have a bad cold, but you can still do things, like you can go out. I mean, I guess. Nowadays, maybe we shouldn't be going out. You can go out. You can do things. You still feel horrible. You can feel really crap with a cold, but it's just not the same debilitating level as a flu, I think."
ts11_23,"Yeah, so, so the flu is, do you think there are differences in symptoms or is it just in severity?","Um, I think there were some differences in symptoms. So in my head, the flu, to me, is more of a high temperature achey limbs, plus the symptoms of a cold and then like sore throats and things. So I think it's probably some of that. It's like a high severity of some plus others, if that makes sense."
ts11_24,"Yeah, no. That makes sense to me. So if one of your children was coming down with flu is that, you know, what would the, what would be the thing that tips you off that they were getting flu, as opposed to a cold?","I think probably being slightly more lethargic than normal. Or if I give them some, so they have a cold, and they sometimes when they first start nursery they kind of you feel like they've got cold every day or something. And so kind of feel like with a cold, I know they tend to get a snotty nose, they might have a bit of a cough. They occasionally have a temperature but a temperature is not something I would expect to hang around for too long with a cold, maybe kind of few hours, give them some medicine and if they recover from the medicine, then I'd assume thats a cold. If they have a temperature that's lasting and I'm giving the medicine and it works for a bit, but then it comes back then I would think that's something."
ts11_25,That's when you start to think that it's flu?,Yeah.
ts11_26,"Yeah, so if you knew, you know, obviously nobody wants their children to get sick but if you knew that one of your children was going to come down with the flu. Is that something that you would be worried about, or is it something that you're more like ""well you know kids get sick. It's not the end of the world""?","So I'd be concerned more that it would be something unpleasant for them to go through. But I don't particularly think either of them are, which is probably a big mistake, but I don't particularly think either of them and the sort of kids that would end up in hospital. Like they don't have any of the underlying conditions. They both have had lots of colds and things and recover quite quickly. So I guess I, when I go a bit like my grandma and say they both got good constitutions. So I wouldn't be too worried even though I know that flu can be serious for kids I feel like they're out the danger age. If, if they were baby so if we're talking when like [Younger Child] was, say, three, four months old, then I would have worried because I would have felt she's at the age where it actually could cause quite significant problems. But I don't think I find it worrying and that's partly that age and partly that I feel that they deal with illnesses pretty well."
ts11_27,"Yeah. So that's because they're they're generally healthy and they're not, you know, tiny, tiny little infants you feel like they would probably do okay.",Yeah.
ts11_28,"Um, so how long if they had flu, how long would you expect them to be ill for?",I would probably say about a week to 10 days.
ts11_29,"A week to 10 days. And do you, you mentioned that you had flu as a child. Do you know anyone who has a child that has gotten sick with the flu? Like maybe one of your kids' friends or something?","No to be fair I don't actually... I'm just trying to think. No, I mean like, I know older people that have had the flu. Like my mum has the flu, had the flu, and my mum is post chemo so is quite high risk for those things. But children, I've not. I don't think I've heard of a child having food for a long time. If I'm honest."
ts11_30,"Yeah, sure. So when you want to learn more about a sickness, like the flu, whether that's anything from symptoms, to treatment, you know, just anything about a sickness. Where do you go to get that information?","So I use a mixture. I use my mum and dad. Or but I probably, I don't use my mum and dad because their my mum and dad. I use them because I know that they're nurses, so I use them for that. And then I will also Google and but I'm a researcher as well so I try and avoid the crazy Google Sites.I'll kind of stick to things like NHS, are reasonably good, I sometimes use them. Some of the American sites too, is it may Mayo Clinic? I find they can be quite good. So I do that. And I guess with the flu, and this is probably highly wrong, I feel like I know what the symptoms are and I don't google those as much. But if it was a symptom that I hadn't expected to link to the flu, then I would, I would probably speak to my mum first and then maybe Google if I didn't trust my mum's answer."
ts11_31,"Sure. So it sounds like you, you talk to your parents because they're medical professionals and then if you want to do some research on your own, you go to websites that are from like, a you know, sort of a professional health authority like the NHS or Mayo Clinic.","Yeah yeah I try and go to a trusted source because there are a lot of um. Because as a mum, for some reason, it seems to be an automatic thing you do, you join loads of family Facebook groups. And then you see some of the information that people share on there and you kind of want to silently cry and go ""no, no, that's wrong!"" So I would never go anywhere like that because I just, it's like running out into the street going ""I want everyone's opinion on this!"" And you've got the crazy mum down the road and you get so and so's. So yeah, I avoid places like that. I would use places like that for sharing, for getting maybe tips on say good medication or like, you know, ""has anyone found some medication that your kid will take because mine don't like strawberry flavour"" or something like that. So I'd use that, but not the symptoms."
ts11_32,"Yeah, so it's more. It sounds like what you're saying is it's more like, maybe, I don't know if parenting strategies are the right words. It's not exactly a parenting thing. Sort of like coping mechanisms, maybe.","Yeah, yeah."
ts11_33,"Just kind of home treatment options, rather.","Yeah. And again, I'm still wary of that because I've seen people say like ""put garlic in your socks"" and you're like ""no!""."
ts11_34,"Yeah. Um, have you ever talked to medical professional, other than the ones in your family, about the flu or have you had no reason to?","I've not really had a reason to I think, oh I did ask because there was a shortage of the flu vaccine. I think the last time that she went to get it, And so I asked about what the difference was between the injection and the nasal thing because I'd been trying to get the flu vaccine for my youngest. Because there'd been a shortage, I was gonna, I was looking at paying for it privately but nobody would do the nasal thing privately. So I asked him, about the injection and whether it was worth giving a three year old an injection because she's reasonably  un-bothered by injections. So I'd been asking about the difference between the type of vaccinations, but not actually flu itself really."
ts11_35,Yeah. So did you was that it can you tell me a little bit about like how that conversation happened. Was that something you like called the GP about?,"Yes, so I hadn't had the letter but I knew she was due a flu vaccine and I hadn't had anything from the GP. So I rung up the GP and they said that they had a shortage and so they weren't, they would contact me as soon as they had some medication. I find it very difficult talking to my GP practice because it's like getting blood out of stone sometimes. and you're just like ""Well do you have any idea how long it's going to be?"" because I was trying to judge whether it was worth just holding out. I could delay could be a month, or whether the delay was going to be so long that we will pass flu season and there was really no, you know, there was no point, getting the injection, should I just go and get it done myself. And being a student, I was been a bit stingy as well because I didn't want to pay for it. So I was like, I was trying to judge it like that. And I find it very, I don't find that I get that good information when you ask questions. I find this is still a very kind of, probably just my just my GP practice, its very paternalistic. It's like ""We will get in touch. She'll have it when she gets one. We've got it. There's nothing else you need to think about."" So I then rung up other pharmacies locally and so ""do you do it privately?. Will you do it privately for child?"" And most said no, they wouldn't. I found it very difficult to find anyone that would give it to a three year old."
ts11_36,"Huh, that's interesting.","Yeah, and I found it. I found it interesting, because I thought it would just be an automatic thing that you would just be able to pay for it, get it. I never realized how difficult it was and I never found anyone that would give it to her. And then the vaccine came in. So I managed to go to the GP practice and I tried to have a conversation then but I found I very much didn't get a response. You know it was very ""No you won't get that."" And that was very, that was the answer. I tend to get, I don't often speak to my GP practice about things because I find them quite difficult to speak to, they don't. It's almost like they feel you're questioning their ability, rather than having a conversation."
ts11_37,"Yeah, so it sounds like what you're saying is, they're very, you know, they're not interested in sort of, you feel like they're not interested in providing like education and helping you understand what's happening and why.","Yeah, I think if you question it. They automatically assume you're an anti-vaxer and get a bit kind of, ""oh you know vaccines are compulsary."" Like, look at my child's record, they have had, they have vaccines. Everything. You give me something, you show me that it works, and I will give it to them. I am very pro-vaccines but you try and have a conversation with a medical professional and I find they instantly go ""Well you must be anti-vaccine. So I'm gonna get my back up a little bit and we're not gonna have an easy conversation."
ts11_38,"So yeah, that's interesting. So it's, it's not a matter of the, you know, just because you're supportive of, you know, having your child vaccinated doesn't mean that you can't have questions. You feel like that there's sort of a disconnect with your GP about that. You feel like they think if you have questions, they're just immediately going to have to argue with you.","Yeah, and I, I often have I am will often ask questions, because as which they will vaccine them, and I give them vaccines for everything, I also don't feel you should blindly follow the medical professionals."
ts11_39,"Yeah, sure.","They're not always right. So, so I think it's good to have questions and to be answered like you're an adult and I often don't feel like you're spoken to like you're an adult. But, I mean, obviously, that's my experience with my GP. I'm not saying that there are not great GPs out there."
ts11_40,"Yeah, absolutely. No, that's, that's really good to know. Thank you for kind of walking me through that. Um, so what do you think the benefits are of having your child get the, for these questions I'm asking specifically about about [Younger Child].  So what do you think the benefits are of having your child get the flu vaccine?","And so I guess it's just you go out and it's cold, you put an extra layer on. I know it's not going to stop her getting the flu, but it will just reduce risk. And I think anything that can make a child needlessly sick. We don't, we're at a point where we don't need to make them needlessly sick so I don't believe given her her having the flu will build her up to be, have a better immune system. I think if we can protect her. Then that's all I'm doing. So I guess I'm just reducing the risk, the same way as I try and reduce risk when they go out on their scooters and make them wear helmets. It's not going to stop her falling off and banging her head, but it will hopefully mean the bang on the head is slightly less. So that's how I see the vaccine really."
ts11_41,"Yeah, that is a that's a really great example. So it's just, you know, even with the understanding that it's not always perfect. And that they can still get the flu, you essentially just say the benefit, you know, any benefit that it offers in terms of protection is significant to you.","Yeah, yeah"
ts11_42,"Yeah. And what do you think the downsides are of having your child get the flu vaccine? and downsides don't necessarily mean you know it can include things like adverse reactions but it's also, you know, things like cost, maybe it's difficult to get, you know, kind of any downsides, that you can think of.","So I mean other than last year when I found it difficult to get it. And then I realized that, actually, if you can't get it to the NHS, it's very difficult to get it for a child and any other way. So if there was a shortage again then she would go without it most likely. There was, there's no downside to the actual, I mean once they've got the vaccine, the appointments quick, they come through and thats sorted. Occasionally, it's just a case of rescheduling appointment, because they assume all of us a free to to the whim of their child and don't have employment. It would be nice if they wrote to the father occasionally got him sort out the vaccine. But that's a whole other argument, I won't go down my feminist rant. And then like there's no issue with actually having it they, they've never, neither of them have ever had a particularly, [Younger Child] has never had an issue with having it. It's not uncomfortable, she normally gets a cake afterwards as bribery. So she's quite happy with it. I can't really think of any negatives. I guess the main negative would be that I am very pro the NHS and I'm not used to paying for health things. So if it came to the situation where I'd have to pay for, it based on my current situation, then I'm not sure I could afford to pay for the whole family to be vaccinated. I guess that's the only potential thing. I can see as women issue."
ts11_43,"Yeah, no, that's that seems like a downside, especially with, you know, just having had the experience where you're, you're not confident you'll get it through the NHS. So that makes, that definitely makes sense to me. So if you, this is sort of a similar we talked about this a little bit, but just to make sure I kind of understand correctly. If you want to learn about a vaccine specifically, where do you go to get that information? Is that something similarly, you do online it sounds like [inaudible] GP about.","About. Yeah, so, um, my mum because she's school nurse, she does a lot of vaccines. So any childhood vaccines. I often ask her, and she will send me stuff if I'm unsure about anything. I mean most of the vaccines that they've had have been major vaccines that have been around for a long time. So I've not really had any major concerns or questions that I've needed to ask. So I kind of use her mainly because I know she's pretty good with childhood vaccines and and then I occasionally would yeah I would go online as well. Yeah, they're the main ones. I probably, because I don't expect to get a response now from the GP. I don't always bother now really. If it was something new that maybe I would ask. So like my research is in HPV and head and neck cancer so I know that my oldest one will come up to that in a few years, but I feel comfortable with giving her that because I've got a bit of background knowledge about that even though thats a newer vaccine.  If they were to come up with a vaccine for COVID, then I might do a bit more research because I'm a little suspicious about how quick these vaccines have been developed and are coming out. So there I might be a little bit more like ""Well, let's just see for a little bit."""
ts11_44,"Yeah, to do a little research, maybe wait a bit.","Yeah, but because most of the vaccines they've had have been something that I know has been around for a long time I'm feeling reasonably confident in those."
ts11_45,"Yeah, that makes sense to me. Um, so I just want to make sure I'm kind of understanding correctly, it sounds like a little what's happened is that because you've tried to talk to the GP before and you've not had, you've not felt positive about those experiences it sort of makes it so that going forward, you just don't feel like it's worthwhile or that that's going to be a productive conversation.",No.
ts11_46,So that's sort've turned you away from talking to the GP about these things.,"Yeah, definitely. Yeah."
ts11_47,"Yeah, thank you for explaining that to me and helping me understand that. Ah, so again, we've talked a little bit about these next few questions, but it's it's just helpful to me to make sure I'm understanding you clearly. So [Younger Child] was vaccinated. This year, is that right?",Yeah.
ts11_48,"Um, and can you just walk me through the process kind of from start to finish of exactly how getting how getting her vaccinated worked out. So it started with an invitation. Is that right?","So it started with... I am trying to remember whether... I definitely got something through the post and I'm trying to remember whether I got the appointment on that letter as well because I have a feeling... From memory, I got the letter and the appointment time together and and then I rung to reschedule the appointment to a time I could make it. And I think I had about maybe a week or two weeks notice the appointment time and then when I changed it. It was only by a day. So it wasn't that much of a difference. And then it's done by the nurse in our practice so once we got the important time sorted it was just going there. Normally you never go in at the appointment time, so I think we had, we were there for about 40 minutes and went in. She just did, had the nasal spray. So she always gets me to sit with [Younger Child] on my knee and hold her still, although to be fair that's not really needed with [Younger Child], and then she had it had it up the nose and she complained about tickling and then that was pretty much it really."
ts11_49,"Yeah. Um, so was the, was it this past year, you know, and I said this year. I mean, the 2019/2020 flu season. So probably this would have been happening in the fall of 2019.",Yeah.
ts11_50,"Is that, was that, was it this year that you had the difficulty getting the appointment for her for the vaccine?","Yeah, that's why there was the delay in the vaccine. Yeah."
ts11_51,"So when you, when you received the letter and they gave you the the appointment time, was, that was, was that when the delay was? Was the appointment for quite a while in the future?","No, I hadn't received a letter at all. But because my oldest one gets the vaccine through school, and she'd had a letter through school saying, she was due her flu vaccine. And then we had a letter to say that they canceled the flu vaccine day and because they didn't have enough vaccine. That's when I suddenly realized, actually I've not heard anything from the GP about [Younger Child], let me ring, because there's always rumors going around and there was always things on Facebook around ""oh no GPs can vaccinate the younger ones they've got priority over the vaccine."" So there were all these things. I figured I'd just give the GP a ring and see why we haven't heard anything. So when I the first time I heard anything was when they obviously had the vaccine in and I got the letter with the date on it."
ts11_52,"Okay, so that was it. So you heard about it because the in school program was delayed, rang up the GP and said, you know, ""what's going on. Can I get this?"" and they said you know, ""we'll let you know just kind of wait and see"". And after you finally got the letter, it was you were able to do it fairly easily.","Yeah, yeah, very easily. Yeah, I think, I'm sure the appointment with within kind of at least within about 10 days of receiving the letter the appointment was kind of really quickly. And then when I rescheduled it. I think I've been given a Thursday and I rescheduled it to the Friday because that was my day off."
ts11_53,"Can you guess at all. You know, I know. It's such a long time ago. And obviously, a lot has happened since then, can you was, do you have an idea for what month it was that she finally did receive the vaccine?","I try to remember because I remember feeling it was very late and kind of wondering whether it was even worth it. So I'm wondering whether it was November, October ,end of October, early November time, something like that. But to be honest. That is about as wild guess as I could manage. If you hold on, I can look and see if it's on my phone that that will prove me massively wrong on my guess. Not sure, no. Its not letting me find it. No, sorry."
ts11_54,"No, thats okay.","It's just a wild guess. I remember I felt it was quite late in the season. But then I can't, if I'm brutally honest, I'm not entirely sure what the flu season is I kind of have it in my head has been winter. So I'm not entirely sure when they would finish, given the vaccines anyway."
ts11_55,"Yeah sure know that it's fine. I was mostly just curious to, you know, to get a timeline not a huge deal. Um, so how important was it to you that [Younger Child] be vaccinated this year? Was it, you know you, it sounds like you had mentioned that you were considering going private for the vaccine if you couldn't get it through the NHS. So it seems to me that it was fairly important to you.","Yeah, it was definitely and it felt more important this year because I'd been following the um. So I follow Twitter for work and I've been seeing lots of stuff coming up about how bad the flu season, had been in Australia. And because I know that we often follow the Australian, kind of, we often get the same impact as Australia does. I was more concerned, though, then I would be normally. So I, that was partly what triggered me going, ""actually, she has to have it this year because it seems so bad."" I know, in the end, actually it turned out not to be as bad as people thought.  I guess at the peak of all that, kind of, ""it's so bad. We're having a lot more deaths than we normally do, blah, blah, blah."" I was like, ""well, actually I think we should. I should really make sure she gets it this year."" So it was really impacted by that. I guess previous years, I wouldn't have been quite so pushy."
ts11_56,"So you had heard that it was an especially severe flu season. And that was what motivated you to seek out the vaccine and think ""this is definitely something we really need"". Yeah, um, so I just have a couple other questions just to make sure I understand your thought kind of surrounding vaccination as a whole. So you have mentioned that both of your children have had the childhood vaccinations is that right?","Yes, yeah."
ts11_57,"And can you explain to me how you decided that they would receive those vaccinations, or was it something that felt like a decision at all?","It never really felt like a decision. I remember being in hospital with [Older Child], my first child, and having to sign to say that I was happy for her to have something, I cant even remember what it was. Oh, vitamin K injection, and I remember that. I remember that wasn't really a decision, it was just like, ""oh, you have you're vitamin k injection just sign here."" And then I remember just giving birth to [Younger Child] and not really thinking, it was just something you did. It was just like, yeah, yeah. And so vaccines or not having childhood vaccines has never been an option for me at all. I've always thought that they that they need to have them. I don't think they need to have homeopathic medicine with a tiny drop a flu in it, that worries me. Um, I guess I just see it and maybe this is silly. But I see it's my duty to protect them in any way I can. Vaccine is a protection and I, I've never seen any evidence that there are the potential outcomes will be worse by having it. So I've always given it to them. And, and I'm the sort of person that doesn't like, I've not given them the vaccine against chicken pox because it's not compulsory in the UK, which I know it is compulsary in other countries, but because it is-- But because it is compulsory in other countries. I have sometimes considered whether to pay for it, but I guess I've always been, I've never seen a severe, severe case of chicken pox, and I know they are out there. I've never seen it. So that's never triggered my need to give that to them. So I guess I just, it's never felt like a decision. It's always just felt like this is what you do to protect your child. But then when you throw in other things. I'm like, ""well, why not protect them about chicken pox?"" things like that. And so they my husband's Indian. So they were both, so my oldest automatically got back vaccinated for TB because we lived in London before we moved here and we lived in an area with high TB. So it was an automatic thing. Whereas here, it's not an automatic thing. You only get it if you're considered high risk. [Younger Child] was considered high risk in case family from India came over and carried TN over to us. But I had to fight for that as well because that kept being delayed and put off and I did fight for her to have that. I don't think she's high risk on TB, but I did fight for that so I'm not even sure where my thought mechanisms are because I don't fight for her to have chicken pox, but I fought for for other things but I fought for her to have other things."
ts11_58,"Well, I imagine, you know, if it's not compulsory, I can see how that would make it feel like less of a, you know, less of an incentive. With you know, it seems to me that with the TB vaccine, there was the possibility of getting it on the NHS whereas it seems like for chickenpox your only option would be to go private. That can start to get expensive. That's a pretty significant barrier.","Oh yeah, I mean financially. Yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't justify doing it for one and not the other. Cause obviously, thats like, ""which child do I love more"""
ts11_59,"That makes sense. And that's a, that's a tough decision. that's actually that's everything I had. So just the way I like to kind of close these us is just, is there anything that you'd like to say about the flu or the flu vaccine or vaccination in general. Just anything that I didn't ask you about that we were hoping that you get the chance to speak to","No, I don't think so. I mean, I guess one of the things I find difficult is we don't open conversations about vaccine. Like we assume that anyone that doesn't get a vaccine isn't doing it because they're a bit stupid. And I don't think we allow people to question so easily. But then I also think we give too much voice to, you know, the Gwyneth Paltrows is of the world. There's no balance, if that makes sense. It's like you either are pro or you're against this. You can't kind of have questions in in the middle. And I think that's sad. And I think if GPs would just allow people to just express their concerns without being judged then perhaps they could help people understand what they're worried about. Because there's so much false information out there that it's understandable people would be worried. It's difficult if you're not health literate. If you're not able to understand health information. How do you make a decision? If you can't have a conversation with someone where you admit to be worried about dead baby cells in the vaccine or something like that."
ts11_60,"Yeah, absolutely. No, that's a really good point. And it's really interesting to think about. I do think that we you know, we have this idea that anybody who doesn't vaccinate their children fully must be 100%, you know, very strong antivax whereas that's really not, you know, that's not the case. People do have questions.",Yeah.
ts11_61,"It's an interesting observation that sort of by neglecting the fact that people can legitimately have questions, we actually might be making it harder for those people to, you know, decide. Might cause people to make a decision in the dark, rather than, you know, kind of being open to them and kind of shining a light on the situation for","Yeah, no 'cause I'm lucky with my history and with my parents in that I can ask them, but not everybody has that. You know, if you don't have the people around you that can help you, then who do you go to?"
ts11_62,"Yeah, it's also an interesting observation, because, you know, if you don't feel comfortable asking your GP those questions, you can certainly find someone some ""expert"" online who's more than happy to talk to you.","Oh my God, yeah. Yeah."
ts11_63,It's a good point.,"And I just think it can be a bit scary sometimes. like, ""oh, you get the idea. If you don't really know why do you want to ask about this? vaccine good. Take it. Be grateful. The NHS is giving you for free should be immensely grateful for this without being able to question it."" And I just think that's wrong. And I feel that I am, I'm someone that will quite happily question and I will question authority. And I know that I'm quite lucky even I will walk into GP practice. Sometimes I feel like I'm quite that strong willed person and even I will suddenly fulfill the role of being patient and them the great doctor and will walk out and go  ""No, I wanted to ask about this. I wanted to do this"" and not have done it because it's like, I've just all of a sudden I just walk in and fill a role of being the quiet patient"
ts11_64,"Yeah, absolutely. There's definitely a very significant feeling at least have a power imbalance between patient and GP and, as you say, even for someone who is confident and kind of knows a bit about that world it can be very hard to overcome. Yeah, thank you. So I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording now unless there's anything else that you want to add.","No, thats alright."
ts4_0,"So the first thing that I will do is I'm going to read you an informed consent sheet and I'll just have you agree or don't agree to a series of statements. If You agree you can just say, Yes, that's fine, or whatever.","Okay, my internet connections been a bit jumpy this morning. So if I freeze or you freeze, so I might just ask you to repeat stuff."
ts4_1,"Yeah. Yeah, not, not a problem at all. So the first statement I confirm that I have read the information sheet for this study. I've had the opportunity to consider this information asked questions and have these questions answered satisfactorily.",Yes.
ts4_2,"I understand that my participation is voluntary, and then I am free to withdraw at any time without giving any reason. I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview.",Yeah.
ts4_3,I Understand the information collected during my interview will be looked at by other researchers from Newcastle University who are working on or assisting with the study and I give permission for these individuals to have access to that information.,Yes.
ts4_4,I understand that information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for use in future research or teaching purposes and that the data will be thoroughly anonymized first,Yeah.
ts4_5,"I understand that the interview will be audio video recorded, typed out and all identifying personal details will be removed.",Yeah
ts4_6,"I Understand that direct quotations may be taken from what I say and used in research and publications, but that I will not be identifiable from these quotation.",Yes
ts4_7,I agree to take part in this study.,I do
ts4_8,"And if you'd like to receive a copy of the research findings, you can tell me now and I'll send those to you have",That would be great. Yeah. Thank you.
ts4_9,Yeah. And would you like to receive a hard copy of the study documents? I can mail them to you.,"Thats fine, yeah, no need."
ts4_10,"All right. And can you just say your name for me. And today's date, please. It's 18 June.",Participant 04 and and it's the 18th of June 2020.
ts4_11,"Yeah, that's the hardest question I asked in the interview, that's what today's date is I really like to put people on the spot with that.","Thankfully, just tells me in the bottom corner of my screen. Because if not I wouldn't know."
ts4_12,"Um, alright, so that's that out of the way so we can go ahead and get started. So you have two children. Right? You said they are two and five years old?",Yeah.
ts4_13,"Two Boys. and has the five year old. Like, would the five year old be in school yet or not yet?","Yes. Yeah, so he's in year one at the moment. Yeah, so he's in his second year at school, really."
ts4_14,"Okay. And neither of them had the flu vaccine. This year, right?","Um, you know what the five year old. I think did, does that mean-- yeah I thought about that this morning. I think he had the spray before the end of last calendar year."
ts4_15,"Yeah, well, they, they do it in school. So a lot of the kids who are, you know, once they've started school, it becomes sometimes a little easier to have them vaccinated right there in the school, but the younger the two year old has not had it that you know of?","Yeah, he definitely definitely hasn't no."
ts4_16,"Okay, what, what's his name, the younger one?",The younger one is [Younger Child]
ts4_17,[Younger Child] and the older?,Is [Older Child].
ts4_18,"[Older Child]. So, what do they get up to these days? Are they, you know, hows everyone doing?","You know, [Older Child]'s discovered Roblox, which is a, I don't know if you know it's a game basically on the iPad so he's he's six on the sixth of July. He's getting a Nintendo Switch for his-- I should see that really quietly. But he's yeah, he'se into, getting into all of that, which is a lot younger than I would have thought and maybe hoped and all but. He also, I mean in the minute He's missing his friends, you know, he loves to play with his friends. Either [inaudible]. He's you know he's one of these people here he is a bit of a rebel at home, but at school he likes structure and he listens to what other people tell him to."
ts4_19,He behaves for everyone else.,"Exactly. But he's the first child. So, he spoiled. So really, we've created the monster that we live with. You reap what you sow is what they say and thats true with [Older Child]. [Younger Child] is a lot more crazy than [Older Child] was sauce as a toddler, super strong willed, loves to play, but is also very affectionate and actually they're both really affectionate boys. But being stuck in lockdown. They've been fighting a lot"
ts4_20,Yeah.,"Proper wrestle fighting now. You know he'd be three in September, but he's tough. He thinks he's five"
ts4_21,"Yeah, yeah, I cannot imagine. I had two brothers growing up and I cannot imagine what we would have put my mother through if we'd been on lockdown with all of us, so I'm impressed by your by your persistence or determination or whatever it is.","No choice, no choice in the matter."
ts4_22,Yeah that’s true. Your ability to cope then.,"Yeah, wine. That's what, that's what parents are doing at the minute to get through."
ts4_23,"Yeah, absolutely. I, you know, you're certainly not alone in that that's already a theme I've seen in these interviews, a lot of rambunctious children at home. For the most part they do well?","I just think I just block out the craziness and just try and enjoy the, the really funny stuff that kids come out with things that they see. I just, yeah. Hilarious. So"
ts4_24,"No, that's, I think, that's nice. I mean, whatever, whatever you've got to do to to get through. Right.",Yeah.
ts4_25,So can you tell me what you know about the flu. Just like in general kind of first first thoughts about the flu.,"That it's possibly rarer than people think. So most people when they're ill think that they've got the flu when actually they we maybe haven't. Typically the flu would absolutely floor you, you know, you'd be incredibly sick high temperature in bed feeling really lethargic aches, pains, that kind of thing. And the different strands each year. So it's something which changes therefore is hard. When it comes to things like vaccines to be absolutely sure you know that you're, yeah you don't get the vaccine and then you're completely immune from getting flu. and obviously if you're healthy, you're going to cope a lot better than if you're if you're ill, or if you're immunocompromised and yeah that's you know when it's dangerous to get it so that kind of things. I think of immediately."
ts4_26,"Yeah, that's great. So as far as symptoms you said like really high temperature you know, lethargic, at all that kind of stuff. Um, how, like, how is that are those are the things you would look out for, if you thought your child was getting the flu or is there anything else like you would expect to see if your kids got the flu?","That's probably what I'd expect it's really difficult, isn't it with kids and viruses, because it quite often is, you know, high temperature give calpol. And what I find with kids that when they're ill that there are a lot more resilient. So I think that they, as soon as we start to feel ill we maybe start to talk about it, but I don't think it's until they're actually feeling significantly poorly that that you really pick up on it. I think that both of mine, quite often when they've been poorly and had things like tonsillitis you don't realize it's that bad. And then all of a sudden they're absolutely wiped out. And then, you know, as a parent, then it becomes a bit more worrying. So I think it's quite hard to pick up on some of the early signs, because they're often so engaged in play. And yeah, then they don't moan in the same way that an adult does. You know they don't start saying, ""I've got a bit of a headache"".  I think, actually, when you realize they're sick, you think, ""oh yeah, they haven't really been eating their Tea for the past couple of days"", you know, and you can maybe see that there was a pattern emerging that they were getting yell, but it's not often until they're really poorly that I, yeah, I would know."
ts4_27,"Yes. Yeah, that makes sense. I think communicating, you know, about being sick with really young kids is part what they're saying and part just observing. You know what they look like to you.",Yeah yeah
ts4_28,So do you know anyone whose child has gotten ill with the flu that you know for sure it was flu?,"No, not for sure. Definitely not now. And I think that when kids get ill and then that illness spreads. It's often just, you know, everything that comes back from doctors typically is  ""oh it's viral, you know, it will pass, give them calpol, stay hydrated. Don't worry about their eating, you know, give them what they want to, if they're, if they're hungry."" So I think that, you know, it's quite hard to identify whether they've had the flu or whether it's just been one of those viral type infections. And I think it's quite often, you know, sickness bugs, there's quite clear signs that you know vomiting is is going on and that that spreads. Then yeah, when mine have had tonsillitis obviously when when they're poorly. You can see their throat, you can feel they're ill. So no, I don't. Yeah, I don't hear anybody say they have the flu."
ts4_29,"Yeah. Um, can you tell me like about what you think getting sick with the flu is like for kids, not so much about symptoms which you kind of already spoke to you, but like, do you think it is, if one of your kids were to get the flu, is that something to be really worried about or would you be more like, you know, ""it'll kind pass on its own"" How serious you think it is? how worried about it would you be?","My children cope better with being ill than we do, as parents, so I wouldn't actually be that concerned and actually selfishly, the concern becomes that we are going to get ill. Because we know that as a child. If they're ill it’s, it's awful for them. And if they're upset, it's really awful. But you can comfort them. You can just try and you know. Get them, het them through that period. I think the worry is ""Oh, now the next child will get it. And we'll have to have two weeks off of work or something. But then, its actually. Oh, we'll get it and actually"" And parenting as a poorly parent is is no fun at all, you know? I don't know with mine when they were younger, both the boys have been breastfed, and it's been like somebody like my mom is apt to come over and just look after the children, just bring them to me, like just feed them and then and then take them away. So I'm not, I'm not particularly worried about yeah the the effects on the kids there. Luckily, they're healthy. They don't have any underlying conditions. That we know about. So yeah, it's not a massive concern. It's more the impact on the rest of the family."
ts4_30,"Yeah, no. That makes sense that and just what you described. That does sound like something I would worry about, you know, sounds sounds like kind of a tough situation to be a parent. So when you want to learn about a sickness, like the flu, you know, anything from symptoms to  what you should do if your children get it. Where would you go to get that information?","And I would Google and probably just go straight to NHS pages and look at that. But then look at other other sites which which come up. I'm not a researcher, but I work at the University and I support academics who are doing social science research. But I have got a bit of an understanding about research. So I would look at some studies and I would have some degree, some ability to evaluate actually whether they were, um high quality research and maybe wouldn't read full papers, but I would look at, you know, look at those and be able to get something from from those as well. I don't have a massive distrust in the NHS. But I do know that certain guidelines are somewhat outdated, or some people think that some of the approaches that they're, they take are outdated. So I would always start with them. But then you know, if it was something that I was worried about or concerned about would look in a bit more detail into other papers that I knew were reputable sort of things like from the BMJ, The Lancet, you know, top medical papers that as a non a non specialist I can access, due to kind of like open access, but also that I have some understanding in so I would explore like that. And then also, I find, like if your child is ill and you take them to the doctor. Sometimes they say things which are in conflict with advice, but actually are based on being a GP for fourty years, and having children themselves. So I think that sometimes you know when I have gone and spoken to a GP about, about one of the kids being ill, they offer stuff which might be classed as anecdotal. But I also believe in some of that experience."
ts4_31,"Yeah. So in that situation, if you know, you imagine a situation where one of your kids had flu and you looked online and NHS websites said one thing and then you took them to the GP, or you call the GP, and the GP said something else entirely. It sounds like what you're saying is that you would be more inclined to trust the GP. Is that, is that right or am I not understanding correctly here? kind of, what would you do in that situation?","I Think that's where I would look look further evidence online and then that's when I would maybe look to other parents as well. So, you know, I'm part of a really big group on Facebook called, and it's still called, slings and things. It's basically a parenting group. I don't know if you've heard of this through, through anybody else, it was based on baby wearing but it's turned into a massive regional and parenting group. So I don't know, its got 10,000 members or something and and it's quite a good place to put out concerns. ""Has your child...?"" So for me, it's, it's about probably getting information from quite a lot of different sources. And evaluating that based on, yeah. Based on my own instincts."
ts4_32,Yeah.,"As well. But I suppose to say that I would do that with something like flu, which I don't think as a massive risk to my child. And, you know, things like tonsillitis and other viral things, but I would never do that If I thought that there was something more serious. You know, when people look to Dr. Google and other mothers for for advice, then you know. There was a time that [Older Child] had a large lump in his neck and obviously, as a parent, that's was really, really worrying. I wouldn't be looking for anecdotal evidence from parents who say ""Don't worry about it. It's nothing. It's just glandular"" I would, that's when I would trust doctors and other consultants to look at that."
ts4_33,"Right, this kind of, you know, because, yeah, so the kind of thinking about how many things that what do you think the benefits of your [Younger Child] getting the flu vaccine would be?","While we said earlier that you know we realize it doesn't cover all strands of flu and that if he got flu and it wouldn't be, I don't think it would seriously, seriously impact on him. I'm not, you know, not massively concerned, obviously you want to do anything that you can to protect your child. So if someone's going to offer you something which could potentially stop them from being poorly, then I'm more than happy to take, you know, to take that. What was the question again Tim?"
ts4_34,"Um, what do you think the benefits are of having a child vaccinated?","Um benefit. Yeah. Again, as I mentioned benefit to the wider family and you know that if he's not going to bring that home to to us. It will protect us as parents, but also with protect [Older Child]. And a lot about taking responsibility in society, really, that if this is something which could stop somebody more vulnerable getting it. So [Older Child], you know, he might be fine. But he may be starting to get the virus, the flu, and be contagious. I take him to a soft play and there's somebody there who's pregnant or there's somebody there, whose child is playing, but has asthma or, you know, and he passed that on, then I think that there's some social responsibility to vaccinate your child, if it's available."
ts4_35,"Yeah, so it's like, you know, there's a benefit to your child. And then there's like a wider, like collective benefit.",Yeah.
ts4_36,"Yeah, that's interesting. Do you think there are any downsides to having your child get the flu vaccine?","No, I don't, no. I think there's a lot of stuff out there, isn't there? The anit-vax debate and all. and I think that while I don't think the government always does stuff right, and the NHS doesn't always do stuff right, I don't think that they would do anything to harm, you know, children. And I don't think that, I don't think they would make the the massive expense, you know, financially. So I just, yeah, I don't think so."
ts4_37,"Um, so if you want to learn more about a vaccine like the flu vaccine, you know, things like not just what are the benefits, what are the side effects, but, you know, things like who is it recommended for how do I get it, where would you go to get that information?","That would, yeah, that would be the NHS or Public Health England or, you know, an official kind of government health site."
ts4_38,"Yeah, all online stuff? there aren't any other resources yould use?","I think that school one sent. So with the older child not with [Younger Child], but I would expect it follow the same process, you would be given a leaflet. You know, and you would be given a consent form. If you weren't taking them to the doctor yourself to do it. So yeah, so that would be that kind of written format and when we took [Older Child] to get his, before he started school, we took him to the GP and obviously just spoke to the nurse and said, and I probably asked her ""Is it likely to have any side effects?"" and, you know, she would have explained, maybe some anecdotal stuff as well as some official stuff. Yeah."
ts4_39,"Yeah. Um, so as far as, you know, [Older Child] got the vaccine through school and [Younger Child] has not had the vaccine. So, was it a decision that you made not to have [Younger Child] the vaccine or was it something that sort of happened? Like can you walk you me through sort of what that was like.","Tim, we, we haven't been offered it for [Younger Child]. So I'm not sure if, I'm not sure what happened last, last year. But we weren't offered it. I don't know whether. Did they just offer it to children who are three? or I'm not entirely sure why we haven't. But I certainly didn't explore it either."
ts4_40,"Has he, has he like just turned two years old?",It was August that he was two so...
ts4_41,"Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm not sure. And I would be, you know, more question for his doctor, as far as why he you know, if it is recommended for him if he should have it. My understanding of what the recommendations from Public Health England is that children who are, two, three and four years old, you know, before they're in school should receive the vaccination. So you haven't you know you were never contacted about it? Nobody ever brought it up with you?","No, no. And I think, I think, actually, when [Older Child] had it he didn't have it until he was three. I wonder if it's something which the local trust doesn't offer it until they're three?"
ts4_42,"Yeah, I'm not sure.","I'm not sure, but honestly, it didn't actually occur to me to investigate. I just took it there. Yeah, unless somebody told me. He did have his, like developmental check, and they asked if all of his immunizations were up to date, which they were. They didn't ask about the flu vaccine, didn't say anything about it."
ts4_43,"Yeah, and was that, was that appointment with this birthday in August that that happened, or is that?","It didn't happen until the start of the year. I think they're always a bit behind in Newcastle. There's quite a big delay. I think health Health severices have got absolutely massive case loads and they just tend to put their classic. ""What would have been the two year check"" I think the form it might be better to say ""between two and three years check and they hope to see you in that interim and that you know if you've got any problems you you would act. But yeah, he was quite late with that check."
ts4_44,"Yeah, I'm so you said that I think that it hadn't occurred to you to even, you know, look into it or anything. It just isn't, just didn't occur to you as something that was an option really?","No, not at all."
ts4_45,"It sounds like sort of what you're saying is that there wasn't really a decision at all. It was like there was nothing. And then you realize that there may have been an option. At some point, but you never really know that option was there. Is that right or have I misunderstood?","Yeah, that's absolutely right. Yeah. Yeah. And if, if the option had come up, I would have done it, you know, that would, I would have. I would just, you know, he would have had it, but that just didn't come up"
ts4_46,"Yeah, that's interesting. Thank you. So, my last few questions Are to help me learn your thoughts kind of vaccination as a whole. So, has [Younger Child], you know, the younger child received any other vaccinations, like all the routine childhood ones?","Yeah, he's up to date with everything which is recommended."
ts4_47,"And as far as deciding to have him receive those vaccinations. Was that something that you, you know, you researched in the same way, kind of, that we've talked about NHS website, all those other resources or?","No, not really. I am, you know, I think that pregnancy and birth and early childhood is quite medicalized and that's something which is is quite normal. There is like a definite movement towards people having more home births people not accepting particular tests. But I'm very much in the, I took everything through pregnancy and through birth and afterwards that was, was recommended. I think that I didn't really, I wouldn't go against that. So even if I read something which made me think ""is this absolutely necessary?"" I think, as a parent, if you didn't do it. I would never forgive myself if something happened. So, you know, it's that. I don't know if I'm making much sense. But I just, I went along with it and I was happy to to trust, you know, that that these actions were really for the, for the benefit of, of children. I think that, you know, a lot of the anti-vax debate is like nonsense and based on poor research and, you know, and yeah, and I can see all of Latin wouldn't accept any of that. And I think that you know the only, the only thing would have been The MMR stuff, which before having children I knew that any of the evidence associated that that was absolute nonsense. But, you know, Ive realized that, but you know they've eradicated, a lot of really, really awful childhood diseases through, through vaccination programs and yeah I'm kind of 100% behind all of that."
ts4_48,"Yeah, no. That makes sense to me. It sounds like what I'm understanding is that you knew what all the recommendations and everything, you knew that these were serious diseases. So there wasn't much research on your part that needed to be done essentially. You were content to, you know, accept that whatever medical professionals were saying to you was kind of the case.","Where as if they'd maybe said ""We can give him 10 injections, which might stop him from getting a cold"". That's where I probably would have said no. But you know, it's talking about things which you know can give children lifelong issues, you know, the diseases that arevaccinated against are si serious. Yeah, I would, I would trust it. That was the right thing to do."
ts4_49,Yeah. Have you personally had the flu vaccine this year?,"No. and I didn't have it when I was, I think I've had it when I've been pregnant before but now, no, not this year."
ts4_50,"Yeah. Yeah, so that is almost the last question. The thing I close on is just like a general, is there anything else that you want to say about the flu, or the flu vaccine, or vaccination in general, or anything that you were hoping I would ask that I didn't. This is kind of your moment if there's anything you want to say.","It's been really interesting actually talking about it and thinking about it. I suppose what I'm interested in and You're probably interested is what's going to happen around the current um vaccination debate. I suppose I want to ask you, as somebody who really knows more, what what do you think is gonna happen. They're not going to vaccinate everybody. Are they going to create a vaccine that if you're poorly, you might get it and you might have a greater chance of surviving or? It's not really about the flu, but just just"
ts4_51,"Yeah, no, I wish, I wish I knew the answer to that question. I think I wish everybody knew the answer to that question. It is, its you know, it is really interesting to just to hear from, you know, kind of where everybody's heads are at with thinking, you know, obviously the flu is a much different virus from coronavirus. Something I've been thinking about is if coronavirus has changed people the way people think about the flu now. Like, You know, are we maybe taking flu a little more seriously now? or is it that we're looking at coronavirus and saying, ""well, at least flu isn't that bad"". So, you know, it may be going in the other direction and now we're thinking of it more like, you know, the common cold. But as far as the vaccine for coronavirus, I have no idea, I hope, I hope there's one very soon.","Yeah, that's what's interesting is like for us all to get a, I don't know if I would feel a bit less comfortable in getting it compared to getting things like the flu vaccine because so many people have had that vaccine. You know the process. Now, is this obvious masses rush to develop something then, for me it's, what would, what would be the long term effects be? So, you know, I might be more fearful, particularly with the kids that if they said, ""oh, we've developed the vaccine. We're going to give it to everybody who's, you know, we're going to give it to everybody."" And then they give it to children and there was different reaction. So that's where there's that weighing up to to do. I think that's why it's going to be really, really difficult and part of me maybe thinks that would maybe be better if they just said to me, ""Oh, you're not eligible for it, and neither are your kids"" and then the risk is maybe a more known risk that as a healthy family, if we were to get coronavirus, we might be really sick. But we'd be okay. Whereas if we get the vaccine, it's the it's even more unknown, isn't it."
ts4_52,"Yeah, that's an interesting an interesting point that you would worry most about giving it to your kids because presumably. I mean, first of all, they're your children. You want to protect them, but also young people, you know, they, they have their whole lives for to be affected by whatever the side effects are whereas, as an adult, it feels. Well, I don't know. I also wouldn't want to deal with side effects either.","No me either, absolutely not! So I don't know. Maybe they're doing some weighing up. Yeah. I suppose it's where it would be, it would be my decision to get it for myself. Whereas, I'm actually deciding for my child so slightly different. Obviously I want the best for myself and the best my children, but there's something about being a parent, isn't it, you don't want anything at all to happen to them."
ts4_53,"And I think you I think it makes sense that when you would be, when you're making a decision that may have consequences for yourself that you, that that's an easier decision than one where you're making one thats going to have consequences for somebody else, someone that you you know care so much about, your child. You know, I can see that that's a very different situation. Yeah. It is. It is an interesting question.",Yeah.
ts1_0,"We will go ahead and get started. What we're going to start with is I'm going to read you a consent form. So this is just a series of statements to kind of let you know, just make sure you agree to participate in the study and everything. So what I'll ask you to do is I'll read you the statement and then if you could just say yes or no, if you don't agree. So the first statement: I confirm that I've read the participant information sheet for this study. I've had the opportunity to consider the information to ask questions and to have these questions answered satisfactorily.",Yeah
ts1_1,"I understand that my participation is voluntary, and that I am free to withdraw at any time without giving any reason I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview.",Yeah.
ts1_2,I understand that information collected during my interview may be looked at by other researchers from Newcastle University who are working on or assisting with the study. I give permission for these individuals to have access to that information.,Yep.
ts1_3,I understand that the information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for use in future research or teaching purposes that the data will be thoroughly anonymized first.,Yeah.
ts1_4,Understand that the interview will be audio recorded typed out and then all of my identifying personal details will be removed.,Yeah
ts1_5,"I understand the direct quotations may be taken from what I say and used in research and publications, but that I will not be identifiable from these quotations.",Yeah.
ts1_6,I agree to take part in this study.,"Yeah, excellent."
ts1_7,"So if you could. Oh, sorry. There are two other two other items here. If  You would like to receive a copy of the research findings. Upon completion of this study. Please say yes now.","Yeah, sure."
ts1_8,Great. And can I send those to the email address that I have on file for you.,"Yeah, that'd be great."
ts1_9,"Awesome. So it will be a little while until we have that, the study will be concluding in August. So you'll receive the email in or around around that time frame.",Okay.
ts1_10,All right. And would you like to receive a hard copy of the study documents by now. So that would be the consent form and the participant information sheet.,"No, that's okay, let's just keep it paperless."
ts1_11,"Alright, sounds great to me. So the last thing, if you could just say your name and today's date for me.","Uh, What's today's date."
ts1_12,That's going to be the hardest question I ask today. Today is June 4.,"Okay, [Participant 01] and June 4."
ts1_13,"Great. Alright, so we've got that out of the way. So now we can dive into some of my questions for you here. Like I said you can stop the interview at any time. Also, if you want to take a break. If you have something you need to do. That's totally fine, just let me know. As you answer the questions I'm going to be quiet on my end. It's just so that the recording picks up what you're saying. So I'm still here, even if you're not hearing me talking.",Okie doke.
ts1_14,So my first few questions or to help me get to know your child a little bit better and to help me understand kind of what you know about the flu. So I see from the expression of interest survey that you have two children. One of them is five and the other is two years old. Is that right?,yeah.
ts1_15,"So can you tell me a little bit about your children, especially the two year old as they're in the preschool age?","Ooh yeah, what can I tell you about them? Um, they're going a bit stir crazy right now. And...."
ts1_16,What are their names?,"[DAUGHTER] is the five year olds and [SON] is my two year old and that's [DAUGHTER] with an E and [SON] with a K. I've cursed both of my children to have to spell their name for the rest of their lives. And they are... really cool. And they are... Really different and I really love seeing that. And so when [DAUGHTER] was the same age, she was a lot further ahead and sort of vocabulary wise and talking wise and things like that. But then certain motor skills, motor skills wise [SON] is, is sort of quite a lot more ahead, than she was at that age. And I just, I love seeing how different they both are and them turning into really cool little people."
ts1_17,"Yeah. It's so funny, you know, little kids as they start to start to grow up, just how quickly you know they become their own little people. Yeah, it's really cool. Thank you for sharing that. So what kind of things have they  been up to since the lockdown started?","Oh, we've been doing some baking and we've done some clay modeling and we've done plasticine and done a lot of playing out in the garden. You want to just one second – And what else we been doing with them. Yeah, playing out in the garden has had some picnics out there, they've had on, what's on a couple of days where it was more warmer they've had their little paddling pool out and and scooters and that kind of thing. So yeah."
ts1_18,"That sounds, that sounds, that sounds nice. I'm sure it's, you know, a lot of work, having the kids at home all the time that that sounds like a good way to spend the time.",Yeah.
ts1_19,"so, would you please tell me kind of what you know about the flu as a sickness?","Um, well, I think everybody kind of knows what the symptoms, um and things like that. I think a lot of people probably think they have the flu when they just have got a bad cold. Which isn't necessarily, I suppose, about the virus itself. but more I suppose people's understanding of the virus."
ts1_20,"Yeah, no, that's great to hear.","Um, I understand a little bit of sort of about the vaccine science and about how there's lots of different strains and I believe if my understanding is correct, they tend to for the next year's vaccine, they tend to look up data and see what strains have been most prevalent in the year before and that's how they then um, decide how they're going to do the vaccines year after and things like that. I know that there is obviously the option of the injected vaccine and also a nasal spray that is especially useful for children and that's probably the extent of my knowledge, right there."
ts1_21,"That's great. Um, so do you think about flu as like a serious illness or not so serious. Can you give me a sense for sort of how you think of it in that way.","Mm hmm. Sort of both? In terms of,  I know it can be a dangerous disease. I know it, and I know that it can have at quite serious um. sort of outcomes, especially for anybody with other underlying health conditions, the elderly and sometimes children. But again, I think that's more in line with the children that again have underlying health conditions and from a personal point of view uh, It's not something that would worry me particularly getting it, but also from a personal point of view I maybe should be a little bit more worried than I am because I don't have a spleen. Um, yeah, it's kind of one of those it's it's it's not something that keeps me up at night, but I am aware that it can have, it can have, quite severe outcomes."
ts1_22,"Yeah. Um, so you sort of got to answering my next question, which is, do you worry about your children getting the flu or not so much?","Again about the same. I'm aware of the issues, especially with my eldest, more so than my youngest. She has the same thing that I have which, the reason I don't have a spleen is hereditary sperositosis which is basically a condition that affects the red blood cells but because it affects the red blood cells it also effects the spleen and how that works, and things like that. And, and basically, one of the things that people with Hs bodies' does to kind of compensate is it massively over produces red blood cells. And, um, so if there is any, any other infection or anything that comes into that, what can happen, and luckily we have quite mild cases, but what can happen is because the body has to start producing more antibodies to fight off whatever infections or virus thats there and the red blood cell count can then drop quite severely and and I've had, I've had to have three blood transfusions, basically because of that. And and my oldest child has has that now it's not normally for something as simple as the flu. Again, that's more because of the fact that we have quite mild versions of it. The three times. I've had to have a blood transfusion once was human papillomavirus, once was glandular fever, and the last time was kidney infection. And so it is, it is something that I would definitely keep an eye on were they are ill, even if it's just like a cold or something like that. And it might be flu. I do tend to keep a closer eye. And especially on my eldest just to watch out for other things you know that, and that would actually be more likely to show anemia because it's more likely that it's it's the flu itself isn't going to be a major issue. But the other things that that can affect in her body would be something that I would watch out for. So I would look out for, you know, pale skin lethargy, all the things that goes along with anemia rather than just the usual things that you would look out for, for cold and flu."
ts1_23,"Yeah, great. Thank you very much. So again you're doing great, you're leading me right into my next question here. So can you explain to me just a little bit like what you think getting sick with the flu is like for children like maybe some of the symptoms that they have. How long would you expect them to be sick, things like that.","High temperature, stuffy nose, blocked up, all of those sorts of things, sinus issues in terms of possibly headaches and things like that And then, you know the those are kind of the things that kind of crossover from from colds and then obviously, you've got kind of joint pain and and lethargy and things like that as well. I would say, that I think it's probably more difficult with children, because especially young children because obviously they can't necessarily say I have a headache and I have, joint pain, I have. So I think it's, it's a lot about seeing how affected they are by the symptoms that they have, because obviously you can have a cold or flu symptoms. But they can be kind of generally finding themselves, still wanting to eat, still wanting to play and then obviously you have kind of the next step up from that where, you know, they just want to sleep. They just want to have cuddles. They don't really want to eat. Ff they do eat, they just want to eat certain things like maybe just a favorite foods and things like that. So I think it's about not just looking for symptoms so much with children, but looking at how they're affected by it."
ts1_24,"Yeah, it sounds like I think as a parent of a young child, part of what you're doing is you know, asking them how they're feeling but also just sort of comparing their behavior to how they how they normally are.","See exactly, yeah. Yeah, and also comparing how they are when they're, you know, pre medication versus post medication. You know they have a temperature you give them some calpol, Do they perk up while they have that calpol in their system and kind of go back to be a bit more normal while they have that calpol or does that not necessarily help or they just not majorly help. And so that's another thing that I would probably look out for, as a parent, is how much is this, the meditation, that we're able to give our children. How much is that helping? And and things like that."
ts1_25,"Yeah, well, that's great. Thank you. So when you want to learn about a sickness, like the flu. Where do you go to get more information on those things?","Oh, good ol' Doctor Google. Yeah. And yeah, I use internet and I would use, I don't actually have a copy of one right now, just do some personal circumstances of having to move quite quickly But, there's like the the Orange Book that you got from the health visitor that I'm pretty sure if I remember correctly, that that has some information about flu in. It's basically just like a sort of minuture first aid booklet and specifically for parents to spot things and children. I don't know whether you know about the Orange Book."
ts1_26,"No, I'm not familiar. You may have, You may have noticed from my accent I'm not from the UK. I'm an international student from the US, but that sounds like a great resource.","Yeah, so I mean it's it's it's if I remember correctly, it's maybe about 20 pages long and it has a you know a quite a broad range of things in that book. Everyday things you know, colds, flus, temperature, sickness and diarrhea, you know, cuts, bruises just all that kind of stuff."
ts1_27,"Yeah, just sort of general health information for parents.","Yeah, things like you know well, you know ""if they have these you're fine, ff they have this maybe think about ringing 111, if they have this go to A&E."""
ts1_28,"Yeah, and that's something you get from your child's GP?","Yes. And do you know we got it rather than from the GP, but from the health visitor. So I don't know if you know about how visitors, but they work alongside and GP surgery but they are kind of specifically there to look at all families if they need any help with the kids. So, you know..."
ts1_29,"Yeah, sure. So my next question. Have you ever talked to a health care professional about the flu, specifically the flu and your child. So have you ever talked to your child's GP or to the health visitor about the flu?","No, not particularly. I mean, If they've been particularly ill for sort of an extended amount of time, which I would say probably more than I week, and, you know, or they have a particularly high temperature that doesn't really seem to be coming down. Or, like I said, there's other symptoms if maybe they've had calpol and they're still really lethargic and not wanting to do anything. I would maybe speak to either the house visitor or the GP. But again, I wouldn't say thats specifically about flu necessarily. I would never ring up and say ""I think they've got the flu"" I would just say they have been symptoms."
ts1_30,"I see, yeah. So my next set of questions is to help me learn a little bit about your thoughts around the flu vaccine and whether or not you think it's something that could be helpful for your child. Um, so what do you think the benefits are of having your child get the flu vaccine?","pretty much the same as every other vaccine out there, it's you know it's, it's they wouldn't use vaccines if there was no benefit. I get that, my understanding is obviously with flu, It's a bit of a lottery in terms of how the vaccine is is chosen and... But I would, I would, I would always advocate for vaccines."
ts1_31,"Yeah. Do you think there are downsides to having your child get the flu vaccine, and if so, what do you think there's downsides are?","Um, upsetting them is a downside."
ts1_32,"Yeah, absolutely. I'm sure that it is.","Um, yeah and so yeah just kind of their, their understanding of it, making sure that they're not going to be too upset. It's, you know, something that I would watch out for. Downside again is is maybe the fact that, and some people say, once you have a vaccine you then get a bit ill. And which, I don't know whether that is just coincidence. I don't necessarily hold much stock in that. But it would still be something that I would look out for just not in terms of all look the vaccine has caused this just in terms of ""oh they're ill, I've got to look after them"". And I, Yeah I don't, I don't think that there are downsides necessarily that I would say that's definitely a downside from the vaccine because I don't, I haven't personally looked into correlation versus causation versus coincidence, in terms of when you get ill after the vaccine. Does that make sense?"
ts1_33,"Yeah, no. That makes perfect sense. Thank you. And have you ever talked to your child's GP or and other health care professional about whether or not you're preschool age child, so whether or not [SON] should get a flu vaccine?","No, again it's not something that I've particularly talked about, and it is something I've talked about for my five year old because when they, when they turn school age so far, they would, their care for things like flu vaccines. Would get transferred over to a school nurse. My children are actually homeschooled. So, if you would normally access the school nurse through what school they go to.  Because they don't go through school, I need to access anything like flu vaccine or anything or any other vaccines, they may need that normally be dealt with via school, school nurse that route, I have to access that in a different ways. So I have discussed with a health visitor about my five year old. And about how, what do I do now if I did want the vaccine, how would I go about that. And now I didn't actually get any answers, so I can't really actually give you any further and based on that again, personal circumstances, I had to move out of an area, particularly quickly and I didn't ask them long before I moved out of that area. So I didn't actually end up getting the answers and then there's been a whole kerfuffle with the whole Coronavirus thing and I haven't actually got a new GP in my new area. So that's fun."
ts1_34,Sure. I'm sure this is a complicated time to be doing anything like that.,One second Okay. Sorry
ts1_35,"Yeah no problem, I'm sure it's always a challenge to get a little bit of quiet time with two kids in the house.",Yeah.
ts1_36,"Um, yeah. So it sounds like you sort of started that conversation with You know, with a medical professional, but then some things came up and you just you weren't able to sort of complete the process is that, am I understanding?","Pretty much, yeah."
ts1_37,"So my next set of questions, in your survey here, you indicated that your two year old, [SON], has not had a flu vaccine in the past year. Is that right?","no. That's more to do with personal circumstances if I'd gotten a new GP. It's probably something that I would have said, “I've got kids to they need, you know. Do they do any vaccinations. What's your recommendation?” that kind of thing. And so that's, again, that's kind of more personal circumstance. Yeah. Rather than thinking that they not need it or anything like that. Yeah. Yeah. So it was something that sort of..."
ts1_38,"If I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like it was something that just sort of happened, rather than a decision that you made.","Pretty much, yeah, yeah, yeah."
ts1_39,"Okay, so again, again, we moved right into my next question here. So the question is, How important was it to you that your child not received the flu vaccine this year?","Oh no, not important at all like, it's not something that I would be like, ""Oh no, they can't have it"". No, not at all. I would I would, I would ask, I would ask my GP and say, ""Is it recommended. What's the best thing to do"" and things like that. And he, you know, discuss the fact that he doesn't currently have any underlying health conditions. Versus, obviously, you know, discussing the other side of that and the and the fact that my older one does have those underlying health conditions and what their advice, what their advice would be either way and then I would make a decision from that."
ts1_40,"Absolutely. All right, that's great. Thank you. Um, so my last few questions are sort of more general, they are just to help me learn about your thoughts around vaccination as a whole. We've talked about that a little bit. So maybe a little bit repetitive and I apologize for that.",That’s okay
ts1_41,So has [SON] received any of the other like recommended vaccinations for-,"Every single one. Except for chickenpox, because I think you have to go private for that."
ts1_42,"I see, okay, but like all all of the normal-","All of the normal routine ones that they get, they've had. they've had them. And they've had on schedule in, in the way that it's set out in this country."
ts1_43,"Sure, yeah. Um, so can you, with the decision to have your children vaccinated fully on schedule. Was that something that you talked to your their GP about was it. How did you decide that they should have those vaccinations.","To me it wasn't even something that needed to be decided or discussed. The proof of vaccine is, is shown across the world. I wasn't, it wasn't even something that would have crossed my mind to, to even think of it as a decision, if that makes any sense yes. Just, you just do it."
ts1_44,"No, that that makes perfect sense to me. I completely understand what you're saying.",Yeah.
ts1_45,"My next question, have you personally had the flu vaccine this year?","Yes, because I only had my spleen, out, in. Oh. In fact, it might have been last at the very end of last year. Ah, I can't remember the exact date. I had my spleen out in February and it was at least six weeks before that, might have been at the very end of last year."
ts1_46,"Sure. So it was sort of like, it sounds like that may have been, was it in preparation for the procedure?","Yeah, pretty much. I had, I didn't just have the flu vaccine. I had a bunch of other ones to make sure that they were all up to date as well in preparation for that operation."
ts1_47,"Yeah. And so in years past, you typically get the flu vaccine or was this sort of, you know, was it an unusual situation because you're going to have this procedure?","It was an unusual situation. And I think because of the health condition I have I probably would have been a candidate for having the flu vaccination, but It wasn't something that I necessarily felt like I needed. if I did have a cold symptoms or the flu or anything like that I tended just to kind of have it one of those things where, well I'll cross that- Uh, Um, I'm sorry where was I going with that?"
ts1_48,"No, that's, that's totally fine, you were saying about how it is something you know, you were saying it isn't a priority, something that if you started feeling ill you would deal with it then.","Yeah. And yeah, and if if it being something whereby I felt... majorly affected by it I would have possibly gone to my GP and spoken about it and things like that. I, I, it's I don't feel like I was particularly in more affected by it, than the average person and that was why I kind of didn't see it as priority. However, now that I've had my spleen out I will be getting it!"
ts1_49,"Yeah. So, do you know anybody who has gotten seriously ill because of the flu or had a child, you know, maybe a friend who has children, that has had one of their children get seriously ill because of the flu?","Not personally, no."
ts1_50,So that concludes my questions. Is there anything else that you want to say about the flu or the flu vaccine or vaccination in general really just anything that I didn't ask that you'd like to speak to this is sort of your time to say anything else that you think I should hear.,"I don't think I've kind of pretty much covered everything that I would want to say, yeah."
ts3_0,"Excellent. So we will go ahead and start with the informed consent. So I'm going to read you a series of statements and I'll just have you say yes, I agree, or no, I don't agree, please. I confirm that I have read the participant information sheet for this study. I've had the opportunity to consider the information asked questions and I've had these questions answered satisfactorily.",I agree.
ts3_1,"I understand that my participation is voluntary, and then I am free to with any time without any reason and that I can decline to answer any question during the interview.",I agree.
ts3_2,I understand the information collected during my interview may be looked at by other researchers from Newcastle University who are working on or assisting with the study I give permission for these individuals to have access to this information.,I agree.
ts3_3,I understand that information collected during the interview may be shared with other researchers for you some future research for teaching purposes that the data will be thoroughly anonymize first,I agree.
ts3_4,I understand that the interview will be audio or video recorded according to my preference typed in that all my identifying personal details will be removed.,I agree
ts3_5,"I understand the direct quotations may be taken from what I say and use in research and publications, but I will not be identifiable from these quotations.",I agree
ts3_6,I agree to take part in this study.,I agree.
ts3_7,Excellent. And then there's just two others here. If you'd like to receive a copy of the research findings. Upon completion of the study. Please say yes now.,"Yes, please."
ts3_8,"Yeah, absolutely. So my dissertation will be finished in August. So you'll expect to get that around. Then I'll send that address you provided. And if you'd like to receive a hard copy of the study documents. Please say yes now to receive a hard copy you will need to provide your mailing address","No, no need for a hard copy."
ts3_9,"All right, so that's that out of the way so thank you for that. And we can go ahead and kind of dive in here. So my first questions are just kind of helped me get to know your child, a little better and to help me sort of understand what you know about the flu. Um, so you have one child is that right?","Yeah, yeah."
ts3_10,And they're three years old?,"Yes. Yeah, she turned three, little girl called [Child], and she turned three in April."
ts3_11,[Child]?,Yeah [Child].
ts3_12,"Okay. Yeah. That's awesome. Um, so can you tell me a little bit about her? Like what kind of things does she like to do? you know how, how things are being at home right now?","Yeah, everything. Yeah. She's really good. And yeah, she's like just any three year old little girl. She's full of energy and really um, like in terms of, like sort of health. We haven't, she doesn't have any health problems. We have been very lucky and until like about 10 months old she hadn't even like had a temperature or been unwell or anything like that. Um, so yeah, she's just a great little girl and she loves Dora the Explorer and princesses and all the kinds of things you'd expect of a of a three year old."
ts3_13,Yeah,"Yeah, obviously she's at home at the minute, and she's doing really well. She's a really sweet spot age where it doesn't, it doesn't really come into her, shes just happy at the moment that mum and dad are around constantly and, she wasn't a massive fan of nursery. I mean she has friends and she loves it when she gets there, but she's not she's not really into it, she doesn't run in there or anything. So she's really enjoying herself, she's living her best life!"
ts3_14,"Yeah, I think, I think for a lot of children her age. It's really more about how the parents are doing because, you know, like you said, they're just happy to have everyone around and having everyone's attention all the time.","Totally, yeah."
ts3_15,So can you tell me kind of what you know about the flu? Just anything that comes to mind when you think about the flu.,"Yeah, so seasonal mainly around kind of the winter period and and that we get, we can sometimes get worst flu seasons than other flu seasons. Um, I suppose the difference, like knowing whether, you know, you've got, you've had flu or not. I don't like, I always get, like I said, people say, ""Oh, I've got flu"", but then other people are like, ""no, I really, really had flu"" and that it can absolutely floor some people, and some people can just feel a bit under the weather. And and I suppose that, like something that I've noticed over recent years, is that sort of flu can, like the strain of it, can change. So different years we have different strains of flu and that there's like lots of different flus."
ts3_16,"Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. So do you worry about your daughter, getting the flu or is it something that you know like, can you give me a sense for sort of how you feel about that when you think about your daughter potentially getting the flu?","Yeah, I think it's not something, I think I worried about it more, when she was younger and in probably the first one to two years because partly because of the worry of whether it was flu or something else like meningitis or anything like that. If she was to come down with symptoms would we know was flu or not? and and... Yeah, really. I mean, she's so, she's so, healthy for the most part, touch wood, that we don't. It's not something that enters my mind as something that's going to happen. Although obviously with recent, the recent pandemic proves that it can have, you know, people can get ill anytime regardless. But generally, and we've not been too worried  because, we've not, as she's never had any real health complaints, we don't necessarily. It's not something that preoccupies us"
ts3_17,"Yeah, that makes sense. So the worry when she was younger was sort of just general? you know, you would have worried about any illness is that—","Yeah. Hello, sorry."
ts3_18,No problem.,"Yeah, I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?"
ts3_19,"Oh no, I think we just, we were just finished, just finishing, your thought. I think I was clarifying that when she was younger, you, it's like you were just worried about like any illness really, and not, you know, not knowing what she had. But as she gets a little older, it seems like you just worry a little less maybe?","I think a big part of that is communication. So when they're very young. They cant communicate why there are, that they're unwell and what the symptoms are. Whereas now, you know, she could communicate more and I think there's just a general, the only concern is that, that something would come on so fast that we couldn't respond to it. I suppose flu wouldn't have been in my mind or something, because flu in my mind would be something that would slowly sort of gather pace. Whereas something like meningitis or something like that. Might sort of just happen in a flash and all the sudden she  goes pale or something, you know, all that kind of, you know, all the signs you're told to look out for. So as opposed, flu wasn't my main thought in my mind. My mind was probably more triggered by the kind of more immediate quick really like a ring 999 emergency sort of conditions."
ts3_20,"Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So you almost sort of started talking about sort of my next question here. Can you tell me what you think getting sick with the flu is like for children? Like the symptoms, what do you expect them to to look like, you know, what do you expect? Can you tell me what you think about that?","When I think about flu, I'd expect to see her like first I suppose, more than anything, behavior. I'd expect to see her sort of be a bit more grumpy or a bit more subdued. And that followed by probably finding that she had a temperature and she'd maybe be sleeping more, not eating. And so I think I'd probably see it starting with behavior and then would probably take her temperature. We've got a little under arm thermometer. And she might get a high temperature at some point. But that might not come the first day. It might sort of gradually gather pace. I probably see, I probably see her kind of maybe having temperatures being quite subdued, maybe a bit, sort of shaky and shuddery and shivery for like a day or two and then for that... So I'll probably only ever think of the flu in like maybe a sort of three to five days, sort of thing."
ts3_21,Sure.,"I don't see a cough, more like just like feeling really under the weather and temperatures and sort of subduedness would be what expect to see from flu in my mind."
ts3_22,"Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So do you know anyone whose child has gotten ill with the flu, you know, maybe any of her friends that you know you might know the parents or anything like that?","No, I'm sure they will have been. But it's like flu, it just feels so common place that if I heard like one of my friends kids that had flu, I'd be like ""Aw that's really bad"". I think the things that probably more like ""Oooh"", like they stick in my mind, is when children get things like hand, foot, mouth, or whatever it is. or like slap cheek? All these like really bizarre sounding things, which actually turned out to be really common. You just don't hear them as much about as flu. Like, I feel like flu would almost be like ""oh yeah that's bad but loads of people get flu""."
ts3_23,"Yeah, right.","Yeah. Like if someone had like hand, foot, mouth for those things I'd be like, ""ooh, what's that?"", yeah, they probably stick in my mind more."
ts3_24,"Yeah. So yeah, so it sounds like what you're saying is, like, maybe it has happened and it just doesn't you know, just didn't seem significant really at the time it was a thing that just happens to people.",Yeah
ts3_25,"Yeah, that's interesting. Thank you. So when you want to learn more about a sickness, like the flu for example, where would you go to get that information?","Ah, mainly NHS online. Um, we did get given like a little book when [Child] was born and which was an attempt, I know it was an attempt, to stop people going to 111 or calling, or go to the GP surgery. I can't remember. Was it like a red book or green book? It's sort of like seem to be the book to go to. And it's got lots of flaps for lots of child le yes"
ts3_26,"Yeah, the Orange Book.","Ah right, thats it! But to be honest, um it wasn't intuitive to use, even though, like if there wasn't this Google and there's the NHS website and that just feels more immediate. I just I say, I type the words and so I would look at that. And I would probably look at that and I would probably pay attention when the BBC or other main news outlets were reporting on flu, I'd probably sort of listen or read an article. So if they're kind of saying ""we're expecting a really bad flu season"" or something like that, I'd probably pay attention to that kind of media. But mainly I would just go onto NHS online for a quick read, but quite quickly after that if I had any concerns, I'd ring 111. I definitely have done previously, Id leave the Orange Book... I just, the Orange Book just felt like let sometimes when you're flicking through it. It's like, it just felt like taking the time to flick through. It was like wasting time finding out, which almost like now I'm saying it to you, sounds insane and, you know..."
ts3_27,"No, it makes sense because it sounds like what you're saying is, you know, why would you bother like to look through this book when you can get the information quickly online.",Yeah.
ts3_28,"Why would you bother to look for something that may or may not be in there? You can go straight to, you know, 111 and talk to someone, or go straight to the NHS website it's, you know, whatever is more convenient whatever is faster. I think makes sense to me.","Yeah, exactly."
ts3_29,Have you ever talked to your daughter's GP about the flu or to like any other health care professional?,"Not really, Hang on a second. I'm gonna--"
ts3_30,"Yeah, no, no problem at all. So the, the question we were talking about was, Have you ever talked to your daughter's GP or doing other healthcare professional about the flu?","No, not specifically. I don't think we've ever suspected she had flu. So that would be the only time that I would probably talk to the GP or nurse practitioner and about it."
ts3_31,"Yeah. Makes sense. Um, so my next sort of set of questions just help me learn your thoughts about the flu vaccine and whether or not something that you know, you think would be helpful for your daughter. Uh, what do you think the benefits are for your from getting the flu vaccine?","Um, that she was protected from whatever strains the clever people in the laboratories think were most dangerous in that winter period. Um, I don't think I ever think she's getting totally covered, but getting protected from more severe ones, strains. I suppose, because she goes to nursery as well. I felt like it gave her some. So, she just started going to nursery at 10 months and that was literally when she started becoming ill, which then in my mind makes me associate it with when she started mingling with more kids not to say that she didn't see kids, but not to the same level and intensity. And that was when she started to get like sniffles and stuff like that. And it was probably about the time we stopped breastfeeding as well. So the whole thing kind of came up when she got there. So, I think in terms of the benefits, there was being, being, I suppose, more protected when she was around more children as well. And so the more risk of catching it was limited."
ts3_32,"Yeah, now that that makes that makes a lot of sense to me. You know, I think. That that age range when they're making the transition to suddenly having all these peers around, I think it makes sense that that's a time when you start thinking about protection.",Yeah
ts3_33,Do you think there are any downsides to your daughter getting the flu vaccine?,"The only one would be the um, the kind of, any side effects, but I don't, I don't, think I, don't think she had any side effects when she had it um... but yeah, that that would be the only downside would be side effects. And also because because it was a nasal spray it was even less intrusive. I suppose that you know the other vaccines, they kind of give her sore arms, are more uncomfortable and more painful but this didn't even have that. So, and that wasn't a disadvantage of this immunization, yeah."
ts3_34,"Um, so if you want to learn more about vaccine, like, you know, side effects, benefits or even like whether your daughter should get this vaccine. Where do you go to get that information?","Ah NHS again, website. I stay very clear of mummy blogs and mummy websites and forums. Because yeah, they just really rial me more than I find that supportive or reassuring. So, and yeah, it would just be the NHS website and I suppose I might have, I might have talked to the nurse or GP about it. But generally, as well I think I just probably absorbed media around it and the kind of public discourse about the importance of vaccines and stuff like that. And it might have a little bit to do with the type of role I'm in. In terms of hearing about benefits of different things and health, vaccines as well might have an impact. So it's probably just absorbed the media, the positive media around the importance of the vaccine and and then yeah, I would read about the pros and cons on NHS website."
ts3_35,"Yeah. And so your daughter was vaccinated this flu season, is that corrrect?",Yeah.
ts3_36,"Yeah, so how important was it to you that she would be vaccinated this year? Was it something that you were, you know, ""as soon as it became available, we're making an appointment"" or was it something that was a little more like now ""well, we'll see what happens""?","Yeah. Therein lies a really interesting story because and so we moved to Whitley Bay from Newcastle last year. So we were new to our doctor surgery by the time the flu jab season came around. So I rang, to kind of check, you know, ""is she going to be on the list to get it?"" because I was very keen for her to get it. And I got told, ""yes you'll be in touch"" and I didn't hear things for months and it was probably November time I started to think, ""ooh definitely getting into flu season now. she's still not had it"" and then it turned out there was like a lack of actual vaccines. Um and yeah, there'd been a shortage or whatever, something had happened and so it was delayed and delayed and delayed. And then I started to hear other friends, even in Whitley Bay within different GP practice areas, were getting their children vaccinated. And that started to make me more stressed, kind of thinking ""I really, really want her to I definitely really wanted her to have it"" and it ended up becoming, I just thought we'd walk in there, would make an appointment once the season started and the most vulnerable have been like sorted, but it ended up being like a whole kind of cat and mouse of when when was she going to be able to get it? To the point where, at one point, Ijust rang up and was like ""can I book my child in?"" and I think it was December. I was like, ""can I put my daughter down and for the flu jab?"" And then they said admin lady said yes, and then I gave her [Child]'s name and then she went, ""oh, is she vulnerable person?"" and she had, that she had like a session open for me to offer to go in. And then she was like ""Oh no, you cant go because she's not vulnerable."" And I was like, ""well, hang on a second because it's like December now. If all the vulnerable people should have had, they've had communication. It's their choice if they're not getting it now. If you've got slots and you've got it. Please, can my child have it because I'm actually now trying to push for it to get it."" And and then it was like ""no, just hold on they'll call."" And I think she got it just before Christmas in the end. So actually, I really did have to fight for it. And it felt, like it felt, like a very, this, so this was the first year that [Child] was eligible to have it because the previous year, she was still under two. So, wasn't, she was in that kind of like blank area. I kind of felt like, and I expected, to just get in there and have it. And the first thing was a concern that there was a supply, like a supply issue. And then secondly, that it felt like, it felt a little bit like bureaucracy was getting in the way a little bit. Not to say that,  I absolutely am for the priority being vulnerable people, but I felt like there was a, there was like a, then, when are they going to just open up to everyone else? It was just, yeah. I felt like it got caught and bureaucracy as well. Sorry."
ts3_37,"Yeah, no, that's great. You, you spoke to one of my other questions, which is was any part of the process of getting vaccinated challenging and it sounds like most of the process was challenging. Something you said I thought was really interesting was that you needed to be very persistent",Yeah.
ts3_38,it sounds like you really needed to to kind of continually advocate for your child. That it wasn't something that was just going to happen on its own.,"Definitely, I actually almost changed GP practices and because I know, I knew that my two friends daughters got it and it's just, it's not far away, but they were like, ""Oh, no, no, you can't do that"" and it was like ""okay fair enough"", that is, you know, so I was maybe even changing. Our GP practices literally over the road to us, which I felt, you know, and I didn't really want to have to change. And there was something else. I kind of wanted to say about that as well. Just that. And I suppose. Oh yeah, there was, there was um, in during this period of November, December, there was some sort something nasty going around, which wasn't COVID, it was something something was going around. I can't remember what it was. And I think it was a sickness bug or something and then, and the public health advice, was ""get the flu vaccine that's your best line of defense, any children need to get flu vaccine"". And I was like, ""I'm trying to get it, I can't!"" And then I can't remember what it was. There was some, something going around and like a real sickness making bug and the flu vaccine was said to be a good protector for children."
ts3_39,"Now they say that, I do remember in in the fall at my uni, there is something going around a lot of a lot of, a lot of my friends were getting, you know, very ill.","Yeah, right."
ts3_40,"So its interesting, you know that they were recommending vaccination as well to mitigate the that.","Yeah, but at the same time, it just felt as a public health message, It was just like, ""get the flu jab, get the flu jab."" But they knew they had shortages of the nasal spray. And yeah, which is frustrating."
ts3_41,"Yeah, it sounds like you saw that there is a bit of a disconnect between the people promoting the vaccine and what was actually happening, you know, on the ground. So I guess my last few questions are just sort of more general and they helped me so learn a little bit about your thoughts surrounding vaccination as a whole. Has your daughter received any of the other like routine vaccinations?","Yeah, yeah, she's had everything and and so she's in the age group at the minute. And so she was she'll be coming up to getting her preschool immunizations in the next month or two and, and me and my kind of antenatal friend's, mums were all talking about it because she's the youngest a lot of them are now being asked, because I think you have it, four months after your third birthday ish. And there's been a lot of concern about going in, because of COVID, but I wouldn't, like that wouldn't concern me because generally, I kind of feel like it's, without wanting to get too, like its kind of almost a civic duty to get your child inmmunized. Because it's not about just your child. It's about all the children and I kind of get that, that the kind of herd immunity or whatever is really important. And, and, yeah, it probably I'm like so pro for it, but I find it very frustrating when people don't see the science and the logic behind it."
ts3_42,"It's interesting. Something you've, you've mentioned twice now, when you talk about the importance of having your daughter vaccinated. You're talking, you've mentioned twice the sort of collective benefit, you know that you know you wanted to protect her from getting sick at the nursery, but also you know, from spreading the flu. They're so interesting. It seems like you a big part of the benefit of vaccination, both for flu and more generally, seems to be the collective protection for you. Does that seem accurate or have I misunderstood?","Yeah, no, definitely. I definitely think it's that, tha,t you know. You know, once again, listening to the news headlines around measles. As an example, and how it's on the rise, and that's there's a good chance that's linked to, you know, people not taking up the immunization. It kind of goes along the same lines of that. And yeah, and my I don't know if this kind of fits with you, your question and but my parents are quite elderly as well. And so I think I was, and up until COVID, she was going round to their house, to kind of, for a night sometimes, a sleep over. So my mum's, my dad's 83, my mom's 73 and they're both, you know, fit and well. But, yeah, I think I was worrying for them specifically as well that if someone was to bring flu to them, that wouldn't be a good thing. And then conversely, they are totally anti vaccine really. So I kind of think, well, also what they're bringing to [Child], which you're not really, you know, for whatever reason, they, you know distrust and all that kind of stuff. You're not. You're not doing it. And like even, like, you know, talking to them about COVID and ""are you gonna if the vaccine comes, you're going to get it?"" You know, my mum is kind of going ""I'm not sure"" she's like sort of sitting on the fence. I'm like, ""how are you sitting on the fence?"" My whole approache is so, so, you've got to, we've all got to do it. And so, yeah, generally my views are that everyone should be doing that, I get a bit judgmental definitely when people don't."
ts3_43,"Yeah. Fair enough. It's, it's definitely an issue that that tends to be very important to people, I think. Not a lot of people you know, tend to be on the fence for that question. So have you personally had the flu vaccine this year?","No, because I'm not in a group that it needed and a lot of my my work doesn't rely on me being frontline with patients. And so I didn't get it. I did have it though. When I was pregnant, and it was during flu season I did get it then. So yeah, that's the only, that's the only time I've had it because I was obviously classes. One of the groups."
ts3_44,"Yeah, so that's almost everything. The last thing that I like to close on, is there anything else you want to say about the flu, or the flu vaccine, or vaccination in general, or anything that I didn't ask about that you'd like to speak to?","Ah no, I just think, I think just going back to my previous point, and I think I probably expected, socially, getting the the the flu immunization as a sort of standard and just going to happen. And it didn't end up being like that. And that made me, that's probably made me more nervous and more anxious about this coming flu season and her getting it and wanting to kind of be. Probably you know, I will do the same thing and get, you know on the phone going, ""when is she going to be able to have it?"" Just because probably I didn't move as quickly on it as possible, getting her signed up, we probably missed the first little ones available. So, I think, to be honest, the way that it was handled, that kind of bureaucracy around it and the issue that they had with the shortages has just made me more, kind of like, ""well, this isn't a God given right to get the immunization. Actually this is this is a whole infrastructure that needs to be slick."" And yeah, I think it's just made me probably more nervous about getting her immunized. It's probably made me even more, and COVID has made me even more proactive than I already was about her having it."
ts2_0,"So to start us off. I will read through a consent sheet with you. I'm just going to ask you to verbally say yes or no to each of these items. It's just that you understand the study and everything like that. So the first one here, confirm that I've read the participant information sheet for this study, considered the information, to ask questions, and these questions answered satisfactorily.",Yeah.
ts2_1,"I understand that my participation is voluntary, and that I am free to withdraw at any time without giving any reason. I also understand that I can decline to answer any questions during the interview.",Yes
ts2_2,"I understand that the information collected during the interview, may be other researchers from Newcastle University who are working on or assisting with with the study and give permission for these individuals have access to this information.",Yeah.
ts2_3,I understand And that the information collected during the interview. I'm going to be shared with other researchers for you some future research or teaching purposes and that the data will be thoroughly anonomysied first.,Yeah.
ts2_4,I understand the interview will be audio or video recorded according to my preference. And all my personal identifying details will be removed.,Yeah.
ts2_5,"I understand the direct quotations may be taken from what I say and used in research and publications, but I will not be identifiable from these quotations.",Yeah
ts2_6,I agree to take part in the study.,Yeah.
ts2_7,All right. And if you'd like to receive a copy of the research findings. Upon completion of this study. Please say yes now.,"Yeah, please."
ts2_8,"Yeah, absolutely. So I will send those to you when the studies finished, which will be roundabout August, and I'll send it to the email address that we've corresponded on.","Yeah, that's great."
ts2_9,"And if you'd like to receive a hard copy of the study documents by mail, please let me know. Now to receive a hard copy of this study documents you must provide a mailing address.","No, that's fine email will be fine. Thank you."
ts2_10,"Could you say your name for me, please and today's date and it is June Four.","Yeah, my name is [PARTICIPANT 02] And today's June 4 2020."
ts2_11,"So that's all that out of the way. So now we can kind of move into the actual questions for the interview. I will say, Just right at the start, though. I understand for parents it can be tough when you kids around. So if you need to pause the interview for any reason, if there's something you need to go and do, thats no problem at all, just let me know. We can take a break","Thats great, I appreciate that."
ts2_12,"Okay. Um, so my first question is to help me get to know your children, your child, a little bit better. So can you tell me a little bit about your child. How old is he? What kid of things does he like to do?  That kind of thing.","So his name is [CHILD] and hes three. and he likes to do pretty much anything that's outdoors, you like to play football, he likes to play in his sand pit, likes to play with water, fascinated with vehicles of any kind. And looks like cars and fire truck and all that kind of thing."
ts2_13,"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, those are all good things to be interested at three years old.","Yeah, unfortunately he's also got an interest in YouTube which is occupying him right now."
ts2_14,"So that can be helpful, sometimes too.","It is, it is."
ts2_15,"So can you tell me what you know about the flu? just anything really like is do you think of it as a serious illness. What kind of symptoms do you expect to see with flu, that sort of thing.","Yeah, I expect it to be a seasonal thing really hearin the UK. and symptoms like a bad headache, maybe cough- like maybe sinus kind of congestion and I understand that it can be dangerous for certain people so. People with like health condition like maybe asthma certainly sounds the elderly are, may be more susceptible to it being harmful."
ts2_16,"Yeah, so my next few questions are to help me kind of learn about what you know about the flu and how it can affect [CHILD]. And so do you worry about your child getting the flu? Is it something you would you are concerned about, you know, you mentioned it's a seasonal thing, is it a thing you worry more about at certain times of the year?","I'm certainly more awre of it in winter. But I think just a regular flu is something that we're all going to come into contact with with it in our daily lives. So, I mean, if I knew somebody was ill with a flu. I would avoid having to have contact with that person and but apart from that, I think, that I can't really protect him from but it's something that is going to get. And he's generally quite healthy little boy. So it's not something I worry about excessively for him because I think if you get if you get it its something that we can manage. We can care for him at home. I know what I would need to do in terms of like paracetamol and plenty of rest and hydration. And yeah, so I would say thats my level of concern about it. We've got elderly relatives that we live nearby and if [CHILD] were ill equally I wouldn't expose him to those relatives, for fear of him passing it on to them. Yeah, yeah that about sums it up really."
ts2_17,Yeah. So it sounds like what you're saying is that you're aware that the not super worried about it. Does that sound accurate?,"Yeah, I would say that sums it up pretty well to be honest. Yeah."
ts2_18,"Okay. And you sort of talked a little bit about symptoms earlier, but can you explain to me what you think. It's like specifically When a child gets sick with the flu?","Well, I would expect him to have a high temperature and probably be quite lethargic, quite tired, maybe have a cough and some sinus involvement as well like blocked nose, and I would probably expect it to last at least a week and he wasn't getting any better after about 10 days than I would probably sort of seek some medical advice at that point. But other than that, if he was alright in himself and we were managing it at home than I wouldn't be inclided to do any more than that, like taking to a doctor or anything."
ts2_19,"Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Do you know anyone whose child has gotten sick with the flu or has [CHILD] gotten the flu before that you know of?","I don't think he's had anything that I would call the flu. Now, he's certainly had like heavy colds and stuff butn hes never been taken down for any sort of an extended period oft time. And and I don't know if any other children like his little friends particularly that have had it."
ts2_20,"Yeah. So when you want to learn more about a sickness, like the flu. Where do you go to find that information?","Um, I tend to check the NHS website, first and foremost, really. Because I just think there's a lot of other information out there on the internet and not all of it, you can't be sure of the accuracy of the rest of it. If I had any fears I might, ring um, you know, speak to my GP and there is obviously a health visiting service as well. And we do have a healthy visitor but I don't really have a lot of contact with them. So my first point of call would be the GP and like the NHS website if I was concerned."
ts2_21,"Yeah, no, that's great. So, the online, the resource you would like to first would be the NHS website and then youd talk to the GP if you felt like you needed to talk to somebody talk to a person","Yeah, yeah. That's correct. But, again, I would only go to the GP if there was something I was particularly concerned about. It's not something I would do if I if I if I knew. He's got the flu recovering okay or seems alright I would continue to like look after him at home and only concern the GP with it if I felt like he wasn't improving."
ts2_22,"Um, so that actually sort of led me into my next question which is, have you ever talked to your child's GP or another healthcare professional about the flu and how it concerns your child?","No, I can't say that I have directly, because I haven't ever had the need to."
ts2_23,"Ya know that that makes sense. So my next set of questions, sort of help me learn your thoughts are on the vaccine and whether or not it's something hat you think could be helpful to [CHILD]. So what do you think the benefits are of having your child get the flu vaccine or are there any benefits to the flu vaccine?","Yeah, well I mean flu vaccination is, something that I believe in and it is something that I would consider for him because obviously it's an unpleasant experience while he's young. And it can be avoided, so much the better. Um, just as I think it's quite frustrating for young children when they're ill. They can't fully understand what they need to do to recover and what you need to do to help them recover so they might be reluctant to take medicine, for example, or might be reluctant to rest or to drink as much as you might need them to and just I think prevention is better than cure. And if there's a chance for the vaccine would prevent him from getting flu than that's something that I would be in favor of"
ts2_24,"Yeah, absolutely. Um, what do you think the downsides are of having your child get the flu vaccine? or are there any downsides?","Well I would be concerned about any side effects there might be. I've had information through from our GP practice for last sort of winter seasons flu vaccinations and that included some information around that. Um, but other than that life if he had some sort of allergic reaction to it of have any kind. But I can't receive a downside to vaccination"
ts2_25,"Yeah. Are there any like specific side effects that you worry about, or is it just a general like any side effects that might occur and kind of thing?","I mean, at the time, um, of the flu vaccination being sort of released, last year we due to go on a holiday. So I was concerned that if he had the vaccination too close to us going away it might make him poorly. Because I understand that a vaccine can't give you the flu, it wont make you ill, but I was concerned about him, if his immune system was to be busy off reacting to the vaccine in the right ways, he might come down with something else, like a secondary thing. I would say that I haven't really got any other concerns about side effects or like downsides of it."
ts2_26,"Sure. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Um, so If you want to learn more about a vaccine, like, say you're, wondering whether [CHILD] needs one or about side effects, that kind of thing, where do you go to get that information?","Well, I would expect information really to be provided and when the vaccination was offered and that's been my experience with all vaccinations that he's had so far, like all of his childhood vaccinations, the routine ones. If I wasn't provided with information at the point of asking me to taking a vaccination and I would probably again look at the NHS website, maybe Or if I've been invited for vaccination for him at the practice, the GP practice, without any sort of supplementary information, then I would also request it from them."
ts2_27,"Yeah, yeah, that, that makes sense. Have you ever talked to your child's GP or a home visitor, or any other medical professional about the flu vaccine specifically?","No, when we got invited for the flu vaccine last year I had all the information that I needed. So I didn't have any cause to seek better information about this. I haven't spoken to anybody about it."
ts2_28,"Sure. Alright, so my next few questions questions are, I think you've, You've sort of answered it in a way, In the expression of ventures form, you mentioned that [CHILD] had not received the flu vaccine this year.",Yeah
ts2_29,"Yeah,so it sounds like that was because, based on what you just said, it sounds like it's because you were going away on holiday. Is that correct? You were going on holiday?.","Yes, I am neither. I think it was towards - just a second I got the letter towards the end of September, I think, and, and we were due to go away mid October I think. I rang the practice and said that I wanted to book him in for the vaccination and and They told me that, although they sent the letters about saying that the vaccines and were ready to be booked, they actually hadn't had them into the practice yet and to ring back in a week or so time. So I rang back in a week or so it's time and they still havent had the vaccines, and we kind of played this kind of tennis for a few weeks in the run up to the holiday and then really, we got too close to the holidays. And as I mentioned, I was concerned about having a negative effect on his health for the holiday. And then after that we were into November, and I thought, you know what, like It's winter now. By the time you got the vaccine them through the practice. And then, you know, I kind of felt like we were there without already. And it was a bit too late by that point. So it was just the circumstances around, just didnt work."
ts2_30,"So, so you did try to get-","Try. Yeah, we did try. And when we get the invitations publishing the vaccine that I will try getting the flu vaccine in the same way as before as well."
ts2_31,"Mm hmm. Yeah, that's, that's great to know thank you. Would you say that, you know what was it important to you when you're in that letter. Was it important to you that he get the vaccine or was it something you were more like ""Well, if it's being offered. I guess we might as well""? Like what kind of priority was it for you?","No No, it was, it was a priority. When I got the letter I rang the practice and then it was a bit frustrated by the fact that they sent the letter when they hadn't got the vaccine. So, it was a priority, you know, all of the vaccines have been a priority to us."
ts2_32,"Yeah. No, that's, that's great. I'm sorry to hear thats the way it worked out, it sounds like that was frustrating. I'm looking over my other questions, it seems like you have spoken to a lot of these things. So the process of getting the vaccine. Once you receive the letter, was not, it sounds like it was not especially easy. That, does that sound fair?","Yeah, um, however, you know, theres some fault on my part, I guess you could say. Because once we were back from holiday and back into working routines and stuff like that. I didn't get back on to it in the way that I should have. And the chances are that once they had the vaccines in the practice that it wouldn't, it wouldn't have been a problem. Its just that when I wanted it, it wasn't there, if that makes sense."
ts2_33,"Ya know that that certainly makes sense to me. Thats really good, thank you. So my last kind of few questions are just to help me learn about your thoughts around like vaccination as a whole.",Yeah
ts2_34,"So you mentioned, I think earlier that he has received the other sort of routine vaccinations, is that correct?","Yeah, yeah."
ts2_35,"Yeah, can you explain how you decided that he should receive those vaccinations?","Um, I just think that, the vaccinations, they're important. I think the diseases they protect against whilst they're you know, really very low in this country, if not, you know, kind of really apparent at all, pockets of them do occur. And when they do theyre dangerous. And and the vaccinations have been, you know, running for a long while now and and I think that um you know they're tried and tested and that they're important. And I know some people think, ""well everybody else's vaccinated so much so my child is vaccinated kind of by proxy"" I'm not, I'm not a believer in that. And so I thought it was important that he received all of them. I myself am a practitioner, Imteacher in and working with children with autism. I know that theres a lot around the MMR vaccination and links with that, that still prevail, even though that has been disproven. And so I do believe that the vaccinations are important and are there for a reason and we were invited for them. He had them."
ts2_36,"There you go. Thank you. Um, have you personally had the flu vaccine this year?","I haven't had it this year. And again, that was an issue with supply. I went for one. Being kind of classed as a keyworker from working with a vulnerable people I can claim the cost of a flu vaccination through my employer. So it wouldn't be something that I'd pay for. But the pharmacies locally that I went to for flu vaccination were only providing ones for vulnerable categories. So the over 65 and those who get them for free. And so I had a problem getting one for myself, so I didn't get one this year. It wasn't for the want of trying, yeah."
ts2_37,"Is it, is it a thing that you've done in past years, or-","Yeah, yeah, yeah."
ts2_38,"So that's actually the last of my questions. So is there, I like to close on, Is there anything else about the flu or the flu vaccination, or just vaccination in general. Really, anything. I didn't ask about that you'd like to speak to?","Ah no, no I don't think there is that I think. But I mean, I guess I can get back to you by email if I think of anything else, I think, important."

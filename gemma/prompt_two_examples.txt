Example 1:
Interviewer: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Do you know anyone whose child has gotten sick with the flu or has [CHILD] gotten the flu before that you know of?
Answer: I don't think he's had anything that I would call the flu. Now, he's certainly had like heavy colds and stuff butn hes never been taken down for any sort of an extended period oft time. And and I don't know if any other children like his little friends particularly that have had it.

Example 2:
Interviewer:  Yeah. So when you want to learn more about a sickness, like the flu. Where do you go to find that information?
Answer: Um, I tend to check the NHS website, first and foremost, really. Because I just think there's a lot of other information out there on the internet and not all of it, you can't be sure of the accuracy of the rest of it. If I had any fears I might, ring um, you know, speak to my GP and there is obviously a health visiting service as well. And we do have a healthy visitor but I don't really have a lot of contact with them. So my first point of call would be the GP and like the NHS website if I was concerned.

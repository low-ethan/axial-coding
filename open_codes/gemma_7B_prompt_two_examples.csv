I know that there were, there are certain parts of the country where the vaccine uptake is very low, certain parts of the you know, the world where vaccine uptake is is low.

I think people probably don't see flu as big of a priority as some of the other childhood vaccinations, simply because they might think that the kids are less at risk or, you know, less likely to have a have a kind of serious issue as the result of flu, whereas all elder elderly people might be more vulnerable.

I don't specifically lead on vaccines and screening within the team, but other members do when, you know, they kind of get all the data and all the figures and things as well.

386,ts11_51,"So when you, when you received the letter and they gave you the the appointment time, was, that was, was that when the delay was? Was the appointment for quite a while in the future?","No, I hadn't received a letter at all. But because my oldest one gets the vaccine through school, and she'd had a letter through school saying, she was due her flu vaccine. And then we had a letter to say that they canceled the flu vaccine day and because they didn't have enough vaccine. That's when I suddenly realized, actually I've not heard anything from the GP about [Younger Child], let me ring, because there's always rumors going around and there was always things on Facebook around ""oh no GPs can vaccinate the younger ones they've got priority over the vaccine."" So there were all these things. I figured I'd just give the GP a ring and see why we haven't heard anything. So when I the first time I heard anything was when they obviously had the vaccine in and I got the letter with the date on it.","[{'Original_Text': ""And she'd had a letter through school saying, she was due her flu vaccine."", 'Code': 'No GP Notification', 'Topic': 'Notification Methods', 'Keywords': ['School Notification', 'No GP Notification']}]"
391,ts11_56,"So you had heard that it was an especially severe flu season. And that was what motivated you to seek out the vaccine and think ""this is definitely something we really need"".

So you have mentioned that both of your children have had the childhood vaccinations is that right?","Yes, yeah.","[{'Original_Text': 'Both of your children have had the childhood vaccinations is that right?', 'Answer': 'Yes, yeah.', 'Code': 'Yes to Childhood Vaccinations', 'Topic': 'Vaccination History', 'Keywords': ['Vaccination', 'History']}]"
392,ts11_57,"And can you explain to me how you decided that they would receive those vaccinations, or was it something that felt like a decision at all?","It never really felt like a decision. I remember being in hospital with [Older Child], my first child, and having to sign to say that I was happy for her to have something, I cant even remember what it was. Oh, vitamin K injection, and I remember that. I remember that wasn't really a decision, it was just like, ""oh, you have you're vitamin k injection just sign here."" And then I remember just giving birth to [Younger Child] and not really thinking, it was just something you did. It was just like, yeah, yeah. And so vaccines or not having childhood vaccines has never been an option for me at all. I've always thought that they that they need to have them. I don't think they need to have homeopathic medicine with a tiny drop a flu in it, that worries me. Um, I guess I just see it and maybe this is silly. But I see it's my duty to protect them in any way I can. Vaccine is a protection and I, I've never seen any evidence that there are the potential outcomes will be worse by having it. So I've always given it to them. And, and I'm the sort of person that doesn't like, I've not given them the vaccine against chicken pox because it's not compulsory in the UK, which I know it is compulsary in other countries, but because it is-- But because it is compulsory in other countries. I have sometimes considered whether to pay for it, but I guess I've always been, I've never seen a severe, severe case of chicken pox, and I know they are out there. I've never seen it. So that's never triggered my need to give that to them. So I guess I just, it's never felt like a decision. It's always just felt like this is what you do to protect your child. But then when you throw in other things. I'm like, ""well, why not protect them about chicken pox?"" things like that. And so they my husband's Indian. So they were both, so my oldest automatically got back vaccinated for TB because we lived in London before we moved here and we lived in an area with high TB. So it was an automatic thing. Whereas here, it's not an automatic thing. You only get it if you're considered high risk. [Younger Child] was considered high risk in case family from India came over and carried TN over to us. But I had to fight for that as well because that kept being delayed and put off and I did fight for her to have that. I don't think she's high risk on TB, but I did fight for that so I'm not even sure where my thought mechanisms are because I don't fight for her to have chicken pox, but I fought for for other things but I fought for her to have other things.","[{'Original_Text': 'It never really felt like a decision.', 'Code': 'Not a real decision', 'Topic': 'Decision Framing', 'Keywords': ['Decision', 'Effort']}]"

That can start to get expensive. That's a pretty significant barrier.","Oh yeah, I mean financially. Yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't justify doing it for one and not the other.
